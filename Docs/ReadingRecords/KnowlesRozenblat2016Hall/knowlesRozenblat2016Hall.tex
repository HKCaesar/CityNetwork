\subsection{A Polymath in City studies}

\subsubsection{Being a Polymath}

Across disciplines but uses all to study one object, cities. Importance of not taking disciplines seriously, bridges between disciplines (economics $\rightarrow$ geography ; turned planning from practice to discipline)

\subsubsection{Five intersections}

\paragraph{Geography and Planning}

Formerly, planning seen as applied geo. Hall did not import economics into geo, but made planning more theoretical, provided biography of many practitioners and thinkers.

\paragraph{Cities and State}

Critical view on State actions : actions against urban sprawl ; large projects : London third airport as planning disaster ; divergence of planning purposes and planning outcomes.

\paragraph{Times and Spaces}

Relation between time and space. Waves of innovation : spatial agglomeration produces innovation. Space of flows ; impredictability of patterns. Unique period/unique place : \textbf{cf non-ergodicity in evolutive urban theory}.

\paragraph{Town/Country and City/Region}

Question of regional spatial organisation.

\textbf{Biblio : } \cite{hall2006polycentric}

Functional Urban regions : city regions ; now coming back as global city regions. Entities between national and local policy.

\paragraph{London and Globalization}

\subsection{Location and Innovation}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

Importance of firm relocation dynamics in Hall understanding of regional development.




\section{Synthesis}


\textbf{Citation : } p30 (Location and Innovation - The Importance of Infrastructure, J. Reades). ``What Peter's lifelong advocacy of transport - and particularly of High Speed Rail - pointed towards is the idea that infrastructure investment could ``bend the curve'', \textbf{but only if it came in the right place, at the right time, and in the right amount}''. (rq : says a lot and nothing, quite fuzzy indeed. points however in the sense of co-evolution).
