\textbf{\textit{Reading Record for \cite{offner1996reseaux}}}


\section{Introduction}

\textit{Preface by Raffestin : }

Network and Territories : two notions that can represent both geographical materiality and theoretical domain.

Crucial notion : articulation space-network-territory. Need for a theory, some ``laws of progressive composition''.

Sketch of a theory (from Nicolas Curien) : territoriality = projection of a system of intentions into space ; systems of intention are expressed within material and social networks. Successive temporal imbrications [dynamical causalities ? ]. Importance of power in the process (network operators) : role of governance. 

Role of information : modification of mobility but no decrease. Role of social networks and company networks. Network of cities : also conceptual indetermination.


\section{Linear Reading}

$\rightarrow$ different significations and notions across disciplines.
