The relation between transportation networks and territorial development cannot be ignored by most approaches in territorial science, but remains poorly understood in a quantitative way : the example of \emph{the myth of structural effects of transportation infrastructures}~\cite{offner1993effets} shows that simple causal assumptions do not hold when trying to explain the ``co-evolution'' between transportation network and static components of territorial systems. Dynamical modeling including both evolutions on long time scales has been emphasized as a cornerstone for tackling such research questions in the case of cities systems on long time scale (\cite{bretagnolle:tel-00459720}, p. 152-163). However, a broad interdisciplinary state-of-the-art, based on algorithmic systematic review, done in~\cite{raimbault2015models} shows the quasi-absence of simulations models of that type. At different spatial and temporal scales, various models were proposed, such as e.g. LUTI models at a middle scale where networks are considered static~\cite{iacono2008models}, or network growth models on a longer time scale~\cite{xie2009modeling}, none of which including both network and territory in a dynamic way. The purpose of this communication is in a first part to develop results obtained through a first family of models of simulation that are agent-based toy-models, and then to propose a theoretical framework

A first family of model explores the weak coupling between an population density generation model that is a generalization of the diffusion-limited aggregation model~\cite{batty2006hierarchy}, and network generation heuristics for which biological network generation~\cite{tero2006physarum} and generalized gravity potential rupture are tested.


The conclusions of these first modeling experiments unveil or confirm requirements for a theoretical framework aimed to understand territorial systems. They include in particular a framing of the notion of coupling between subsystems, a precise definition of scale and an emphasis on emergence to take into account multi-scale aspects of systems, the superposition of heterogeneous views and components of a system. Starting from a perspectivist point of view~\cite{giere2010scientific}, we consider a system as a set of perspectives consisting in ontological sets~\cite{livet2010} associated with dataflow machines~\cite{golden2012modeling}. Formal pre-orders between subsets of ontologies, constructed from emergence relations~\cite{bedau2002downward}, yield after a canonical reduction an unique forest representing the structure of the system. Strong coupled components reside within nodes, whereas a temporal scale and ``thematic'' scale (scale for a state variable) can be associated to each level of the forest by construction from dataflow machines timescales. This framework is formally self-consistent and meets our requirements.
