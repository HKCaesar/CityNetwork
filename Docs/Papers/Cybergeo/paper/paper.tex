\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Most of scientific disciplines seem to be in a need of more interdisciplinarity and transversal approaches, as explored in a recent special issue of Nature~\cite{} % TODO cite Nature special issue
, for diverse reasons that may include the development of vertically integrated fields conjointly with horizontal transversal questions~\cite{2009arXiv0907.2221B}. There are naturally ongoing debates on what is exactly interdisciplinarity (many other terms such as transdisciplinarity, crossdisciplinarity also exist) and it actually depends of involved domains : recent hybrid disciplines (see e.g. )% examples from Sanders' book
are a good illustration of the case where entanglement is strong and new discoveries are vertically deep, whereas % urbanism as a field ; 
more loose fields such as ``urbanism'' which has no precise definition and integration is by essence horizontal is an other illustration of how transversal knowledge can be produced (leading to misunderstandings when recently introduced to non-aware physicists~\cite{dupuy2015sciences}).
% ultra advanced physics : interdisciplinarity very strict ?
The question is naturally transferred into scientific communication : what are corresponding alternatives for an efficient dissemination of knowledge ? Elements of answer to such a high-level issue imply, in an evidence-based perspective, quantitative measures of interdisciplinarity.

%  -> the initial measurement pb

The possible methods for quantitative insights into epistemology are numerous. %Existing works in quantitative epistemology using various types of networks have shown interesting potentialities.
 Using citation network features, a good predicting power for citation patterns is for example obtained by~\cite{2013arXiv1310.8220N}. Co-authorship networks can also be used for predictive models~\cite{2014arXiv1402.7268S}. A multilayer network approach was recently proposed in~\cite{2016arXiv160106075O}, using bipartites networks of papers and scholars, in order to produce measures of interdisciplinarity. Disciplines can be stratified into layers to reveal communities between them and therein collaboration patterns~\cite{2015arXiv150601280B}. Keyword networks are used in other fields such as economics of technology : for example, \cite{choi2014patent} proposes a method to identify technological opportunities by detecting important keywords from the point of view of topological measures. \cite{shibata2008detecting} uses topological analysis of the citation network to detect emerging research fronts.

% TODO : why Geography ? -> cool for that ; very broad, classified in many different ways (fr : shs ; hard sciences in other countries ; currently CS mutation ongoing)

We describe here a study implementing these ideas for the particular case of a scientific journal for which bibliographical data is difficult to obtain, namely \textit{Cybergeo}, an electronic journal in theoretical and quantitative geography. It makes a particularly interesting case study as deliberately generalist and concerned with open science issues such as peer-review ethics transparency~\cite{10.1371/journal.pone.0147913}, data and model practices, etc. Our approach combine semantic communities analysis (as done in~\cite{2016arXiv160208451P} for papers in physics but with keyword extraction ; \cite{2015arXiv151003797G} analyses semantic networks of political debates) with citation network to extract e.g. interdisciplinarity measures.


% TODO explain that part of a larger project ; in discussion evoke CybNetworks and the future of publishing/bibliometrics ?




% This research question is shitty, find a more relevant one
% \textbf{Research question : }\textit{How does the combination of a citation network approach with a semantic analysis unveil disciplinary context of the journal ?}



The rest of the paper is organized as follows : we describe in section~\ref{sec:data} the context of the dataset, in particular the scientific purpose of the case study journal, and the data collection procedure. We then give in section~\ref{sec:results} results on interdisciplinarity landscape obtained through network multilayer analysis of the dataset.






%Semantic analysis does not contain all the information on disciplinary compartmentation nor on patterns of propagation of scientific knowledge as the ones contained in citation networks for example. Furthermore, data collection in the previous algorithm is subject to convergence towards self-consistent themes because of the proper structure of the method. It may give more insight about scientific social patterns of ontological choices in modeling to study communities in broader networks, that would more correspond to disciplines (or sub-disciplines depending on granularity level).




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Database Construction}
\label{sec:data}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



The general architecture for data collection is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:datacollection}.

% TODO precise what we mean by reference ? !! it is scientometrics, may require precise use of terms

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Initial Corpus}

The production database of \textit{Cybergeo} (snapshot dump taken at date), provided by the editorial board, provides after pre-processing the initial database of articles, with basic information (title, abstract, publication year, xxx). The processed version used is available together with the full database constructed, as a \texttt{mysql} dump, at \texttt{}. This base provide also bibliographical records of articles that give all references cited by the initial base.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Citation Data}

Citation data is collected from \texttt{Google Scholar}, that is the only source for incoming citations~\cite{noruzi2005google} in our case as the journal is not referenced in other databases\footnote{or was just added as in the case of \textit{Web of Science}, indexing \textit{Cybergeo} since May 2016}. We are aware of the possible biaises using this single source (see e.g.~\cite{bohannon2014scientific})\footnote{or \texttt{http:\/\/iscpif.fr\/blog\/2016\/02\/the-strange-arithmetic-of-google-scholars}}, but these critics are more directed towards search results than citation counts. The automatic collection requires the use of an open source data crawling software to pipe requests, namely $\texttt{TorPool}$~\cite{} % TODO cite torpool -- change Name in architecture diagram !!! or directly ScholarAPI ? -> then must find a sioux way ? or say here we wrote a ScholarAPI using TorPool ?
 that provides a Java API allowing an easy integration into our application. Using it, a simple crawler is enough to collect html pages and get backward citation data, i.e. all citing articles for a given initial article. We retrieve that way two sub-corpuses : references \emph{citing} Cybergeo and references \emph{citing the ones cited} by cybergeo.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Text Data}

% detail mendeley collection

A textual description for all references is necessary for a complete semantic analysis. We use for this an other source of data, that is the online catalog of \textit{Mendeley} reference manager software~\cite{}

\section{Methods and Results}
\label{sec:results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Citation Network Properties}


% summary stats : should be in data description ?
We are able by the reconstruction of the citation network at depth $\pm 1$ from the original 1000 references of the journal to retrieve around $45\cdot 10^6$ references, on which $2.1\cdot 10^6$ are retrieved with abstract text allowing semantic analysis.

\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Semantic Communities Construction}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Relevant Keywords Extraction}

Corpus consists of around $2\cdot 10^5$ abstracts of publications at a topological distance shorter than 2 from the journal \texttt{cybergeo} in the citation network.

Text processing is done using a method adapted from~\cite{chavalarias2013phylomemetic}. We use the python library \texttt{nltk}~\cite{bird2006nltk} that provides state-of-the-art operations in Natural Language Processing. A particular treatment is required for language detection with \emph{stop-words} and a specific tagger \texttt{TreeTagger} is used for other languages than english~\cite{schmid1994probabilistic}. More precisely, we go through the following steps :


\begin{enumerate}
\item Language detection using \textit{stop-words}
\item Parsing and tokenizing / pos-tagging (word functions) / stemming done differently depending on language :
\begin{itemize}
\item English : \texttt{nltk} built-in pos-tagger, combined to a \emph{PorterStemmer}
\item French or other : use of \texttt{TreeTagger}~\cite{schmid1994probabilistic}
\end{itemize}
\item Selection of potential \textit{n-grams} (with $1 \leq n \leq 4$) : English $\bigcap \{NN \cup VBG \cup JJ \}$ ;  French  $\bigcap \{NOM \cup ADJ\}$
\item Database insertion for instantaneous utilisation (10j $\rightarrow$ 2min)
\item Estimation of \textit{n-grams} relevance, following co-occurrences statistical distribution
\end{enumerate}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Semantic Network}

% describe co-occurrence nw




Keeping the $K_W$ most relevant keywords yield the co-occurrence matrix that can be directly interpreted as a weighted adjacency matrix. 

% TODO what value of K_W ; WHY ?



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\includegraphics[width=1.6\textwidth]{figures/semantic.png}
\caption[Semantic network of concepts in quantitative geography]{Semantic network of domains linked to theoretical and quantitative geography. Network is constructed by co-occurrences of most relevant keywords. Filtering parameters are here taken according to the multi-objective optimization done in Fig.~\ref{fig:sensitivity}, i.e. $(k_{max}=,e_{th}=,f_{min},f_{max}=)$. The graph spatialization algorithm (Fruchterman-Reingold), despite its stochastic and path-dependent character, unveils information  A zoomable vectorial file (\texttt{.svg}) of the network is available as Supplementary Material.}
% TODO : Q : should be after the sensitivity figure ?
\label{fig:quantepistemo:semanticnw}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Sensitivity Analysis}


% sensitivity analysis to params/meta-params

The topology of raw networks does not allow the extraction of clear communities, in particular because of the presence of hubs that correspond to frequent terms common to many fields (e.g. \texttt{model}, \texttt{space}). We assume these highest degree terms do not carry specific information on particular classes and can be thus filtered given a maximal degree threshold $k_{max}$. Similarly, edge with small weight must not carry significant information and are filtered according to a minimal edge weight threshold $w_{min}$. Keywords are preliminary filtered by a document frequency window $\left[ f_{min},f_{max} \right]$ which is slightly different from network filtering and complementary. A sensitivity analysis of resulting network topology to these parameters is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:sensitivity}. We choose parameter values that maximize modularity under the constraint of a community number and size distribution of same magnitude as technological classes. This multi-objective optimization does not have a unique solution as objectives are somehow contradictory

% TODO figure seems smoothed (pdf ?) ; redraw png raster / represent with an other color the exact compromise point chosen
\caption{Sensitivity analysis of network indicators to filtering parameters}
\label{fig:sensitivity}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Communities}

We then retrieve communities in the semantic network (using standard Louvain algorithm, with the optimized filtering parameters). At the exception of a small proportion apparently resulting from noise (representing x/y, i.e. z\% of keywords) % TODO exact number 
, communities correspond to well-defined scientific fields (and/or domains, approaches). An expert eye-ball validation provides names to these, a more complicated naming procedure would eventually be possible (as in ~\cite{} % TODO cite patent paper with community naming
 where a chi-square test on distribution of documents in classes), but we prefer to stick here to a certain level of supervision. Table~\ref{tab:domains}

\subsection{Measures of Interdisciplinarity}





Distribution of keywords within reconstructed disciplines provides an article-level interdisciplinarity, and we can construct various measures at the journal level. Combination of citation and semantic layers in the hyper-network provide second order interdisciplinarity measures.
