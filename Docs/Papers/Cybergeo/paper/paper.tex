\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Most of scientific disciplines seem to be in a need of more interdisciplinarity and transversal approaches, as explored in a recent special issue of Nature~\cite{} % TODO cite Nature special issue
, for diverse reasons that may include the development of vertically integrated fields conjointly with horizontal transversal questions~\cite{} % TODO cite roadmap
. There are naturally ongoing debates on what is exactly interdisciplinarity (many other terms such as transdisciplinarity, crossdisciplinarity also exist) and it actually depends of involved domains : recent hybrid disciplines (see e.g. )% examples from Sanders' book
are a good illustration of the case where entanglement is strong and new discoveries are vertically deep, whereas % urbanism as a field ; 
more loose fields such as ``urbanism'' which has no precise definition and integration is by essence horizontal is an other illustration of how transversal knowledge can be produced (leading to misunderstandings when recently introduced to non-aware physicists~\cite{}). % cite Dupuy aggressive transdisciplinarity 
% ultra advanced physics : interdisciplinarity very strict ?
The question is naturally transferred into scientific communication : what are corresponding alternatives for an efficient dissemination of knowledge ? Elements of answer to such a high-level issue imply, in an evidence-based perspective, quantitative measures of interdisciplinarity.

The possible methods for quantitative insights into epistemology are numerous. %Existing works in quantitative epistemology using various types of networks have shown interesting potentialities.
 Using citation network features, a good predicting power for citation patterns is for example obtained by~\cite{2013arXiv1310.8220N}. Co-authorship networks can also be used for predictive models~\cite{2014arXiv1402.7268S}. A multilayer network approach was recently proposed in~\cite{2016arXiv160106075O}, using bipartites networks of papers and scholars, in order to produce measures of interdisciplinarity. Disciplines can be stratified into layers to reveal communities between them and therein collaboration patterns~\cite{2015arXiv150601280B}. Keyword networks are used in other fields such as economics of technology : for example, \cite{choi2014patent} proposes a method to identify technological opportunities by detecting important keywords from the point of view of topological measures. \cite{shibata2008detecting} uses topological analysis of the citation network to detect emerging research fronts.

We describe here a study implementing these ideas for the particular case of a scientific journal for which bibliographical data is difficult to obtain, that is \texttt{cybergeo}, an electronic journal in theoretical and quantitative geography, that is concerned with open science issues such as peer-review ethics transparency~\cite{10.1371/journal.pone.0147913}. Our approach combine semantic communities analysis (as done in~\cite{2016arXiv160208451P} for papers in physics but with keyword extraction ; \cite{2015arXiv151003797G} analyses semantic networks of political debates) with citation network to extract e.g. interdisciplinarity measures.


% TODO explain that part of a larger project ; in discussion evoke CybNetworks and the future of publishing/bibliometrics ?




% This research question is shitty, find a more relevant one
% \textbf{Research question : }\textit{How does the combination of a citation network approach with a semantic analysis unveil disciplinary context of the journal ?}



The rest of the paper is organized as follows : we describe in section~\ref{sec:data} the context of the dataset, in particular the scientific purpose of the case study journal, and the data collection procedure. We then give in section~\ref{sec:results} results on interdisciplinarity landscape obtained through network multilayer analysis of the dataset.






%Semantic analysis does not contain all the information on disciplinary compartmentation nor on patterns of propagation of scientific knowledge as the ones contained in citation networks for example. Furthermore, data collection in the previous algorithm is subject to convergence towards self-consistent themes because of the proper structure of the method. It may give more insight about scientific social patterns of ontological choices in modeling to study communities in broader networks, that would more correspond to disciplines (or sub-disciplines depending on granularity level).

\section*{Database Construction}
\label{sec:data}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\subsection{Implementation}


The general architecture for data collection is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:quantepistemo:data}.



\paragraph{Initial Corpus}

The production database of \textit{Cybergeo} (snapshot dump taken at date), provided by the editorial board, provides after pre-processing the initial database of articles, with basic information (title, abstract, publication year, xxx). The processed version used is available together with the full database constructed, as a \texttt{mysql} dump, at \texttt{}.



\paragraph{Citation Data}
Citation data is collected from \texttt{Google Scholar}, that is the only source for incoming citations~\cite{noruzi2005google} in our case as the journal is not referenced in other databases. We are aware of the possible biaises using this single source~\cite{bohannon2014scientific}\footnote{or see \texttt{http:\/\/iscpif.fr\/blog\/2016\/02\/the-strange-arithmetic-of-google-scholars}}, but these critics are more directed towards search results than citation counts. 


\paragraph{Text Data}

% detail mendeley collection

Text processing is done the same way as in previous section, expect that a particular treatment is done to language detection using \emph{stop-words} and a specific tagger \texttt{TreeTagger} is used for other languages than english~\cite{schmid1994probabilistic}.

\section{Methods and Results}
\label{sec:results}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Citation Network Properties}


% summary stats : should be in data description ?
We are able by the reconstruction of the citation network at depth $\pm 1$ from the original 1000 references of the journal to retrieve around $45\cdot 10^6$ references, on which $2.1\cdot 10^6$ are retrieved with abstract text allowing semantic analysis.

\subsection{Semantic Communities Construction}

\paragraph{Relevant Keywords Extraction}


\textit{Text-mining in python with \texttt{nltk}~\cite{bird2006nltk}}, method adpated from
\cite{chavalarias2013phylomemetic}


\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
\item Language detection using \textit{stop-words}
\item Parsing and tokenizing / pos-tagging (word functions) / stemming done differently depending on language :
\begin{itemize}
\item English : \texttt{nltk} built-in pos-tagger, combined to a \emph{PorterStemmer}
\item French or other : use of \texttt{TreeTagger}~\cite{schmid1994probabilistic}
\end{itemize}
\item Selection of potential \textit{n-grams} (with $1 \leq n \leq 4$) : English $\bigcap \{NN \cup VBG \cup JJ \}$ ;  French  $\bigcap \{NOM \cup ADJ\}$
\item Database insertion for instantaneous utilisation (10j $\rightarrow$ 2min)
\item Estimation of \textit{n-grams} relevance, following co-occurrences statistical distribution
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Semantic Network}

% describe co-occurrence nw



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Communities Construction}

% sensitivity analysis to params/meta-params







We retrieve by community detection in the semantic network typical geographical disciplines, such as :

\begin{itemize}
\item Political sciences/critical geography (535) : \texttt{decision-mak, polit ideolog, democraci, stakehold, neoliber}
\item Biogeography (394) : \texttt{plant densiti, wood, wetland, riparian veget}
\item Economic geography (343) : \texttt{popul growth, transact cost, socio-econom, household incom}
\item Environnment/climate (309) : \texttt{ice sheet, stratospher, air pollut, climat model}
\item Complex systems (283) : \texttt{scale-fre, multifract, agent-bas model, self-organ}
\item Physical geography (203) : \texttt{sedimentari, digit elev model, geolog, river delta}
\item Spatial analysis (175) : \texttt{spatial analysi, princip compon analysi, heteroscedast, factor analysi}
\item Microbiology (118) : \texttt{chromosom, phylogenet, borrelia}
\item Statistical methods (88) : \texttt{logist regress, classifi, kalman filter, sampl size}
\item Cognitive sciences (81) : \texttt{semant memori, retrospect, neuroimag}
\item GIS (75) : \texttt{geograph inform scienc, softwar design, volunt geograph inform, spatial decis support}
\item Traffic modeling (63) : \texttt{simul model, lane chang, traffic flow, crowd behavior}
\item Health (52) : \texttt{epidem, vaccin strategi, acut respiratori syndrom, hospit}
\item Remote sensing (48) : \texttt{land-cov, landsat imag, lulc}
\item Crime (17) : \texttt{crimin justic system, social disorgan, crime}
\end{itemize}





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Measures of Interdisciplinarity}





Distribution of keywords within reconstructed disciplines provides an article-level interdisciplinarity, and we can construct various measures at the journal level. Combination of citation and semantic layers in the hyper-network provide second order interdisciplinarity measures. The construction of null models for comparison and the collection of currently missing data (journals for other papers) are currently ongoing so these results are not presented here.

Corpus consists of around $2\cdot 10^5$ abstracts of publications at a topological distance shorter than 2 from the journal \texttt{cybergeo} in the citation network. Relevance of keywords were estimated with a bootstrap method, and semantic network is constructed by co-occurrences of keywords (filtered following the procedure detailed in text, with cut at larger degrees of 10\% here to delete hubs such as \texttt{model} or \texttt{space} and efficiently reveal communities). A zoomable vectorial file (\texttt{.svg}) of the network is available as Supplementary Material.}
