\begin{abstract}
A crucial point for a model to be reproducible or an application to be comprehensively used is a full and structured documentation, including description of primitives not necessarly directly called by the user. We describe a tool based on filter implementation for \texttt{Doxygen}~\cite{} that allow such generation for NetLogo models.
