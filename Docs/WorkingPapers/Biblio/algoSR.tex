\begin{abstract}
Literature review is a crucial preliminary step for any scientific work and its quality and extent may have a dramatic impact on perspectives for research question and objectives. We propose an algorithm performing an automatized systematic review, to tackle in an original way this issue. Through iterative requests to a catalog and keyword extraction from the retrieven corpus, the final corpus ready for manual screening is built in a more robust way than with a single database request. We describe an implementation of the algorithm and show first results.

\section{Introduction}


\section{Description of the Algorithm}



\section{Implementation}

\paragraph{General Implementation}
Because of the heterogeneity of operations required by the algorithm (references organisation, catalog requests, text procesing), it was found a reasonable choice to implement it in Java. Source code and binaries are available on the Github repository of the project\footnote{at \texttt{}}.


\paragraph{Catalog Requests}

\cite{mendeley}


\paragraph{Natural Language Processing}
Keyword extraction is done through Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, following the workflow given in~\cite{chavalarias2013phylomemetic}. Although powerful and flexible libraries exist for current operations\footnote{see e.g. Java library by The Stanford Natural Language Processing Group at \texttt{http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml}, or Python library NLTK at \texttt{http://www.nltk.org/}.}, the elaborated workflow of the paper would be painful to implement and is furthermore already made available by the authors on the dedicated website of the \emph{CorText} project\footnote{\texttt{http://manager.cortext.net}}.
