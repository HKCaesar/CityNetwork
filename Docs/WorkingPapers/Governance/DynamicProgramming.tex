\begin{abstract}
Computation of accessibilities via a transportation network requires the knowledge of network shortest paths, what can rapidly become a computationnal obstacle in the case of a network evolving at a fast rate. Indeed, implementing a classic shortest path algorithm at each network change implies a complete recomputation of all paths although most of them remain unchanged. We propose a dynamic programming approach that, as a compromise between computation time and amount of memory used, allows a faster update of network paths and distances after a change in network topology.
