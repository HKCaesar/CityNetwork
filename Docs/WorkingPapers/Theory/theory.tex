\section*{Introduction}

The structural misunderstandings between Social Sciences and Humanities on one side, and so-called Exact Sciences on the other side, far from being a generality, seems to have however a significant impact on the structure of scientific knowledge~\cite{2015arXiv151103981H}. In particular, the place of theory (and indeed the signification of this term itself) in the elaboration of knowledge has a totally different place, partly because of the different \emph{perceived complexities}\footnote{We used the term \emph{perceived} as most of systems studied by physics might be described as simple whereas they are intrinsically complex and indeed not well understood~\cite{laughlin2006different}.} of studied objects : for example, mathematical constructions and by extent theoretical physics are \emph{simple} in the sense that they are mostly entierely analytically solvable, whereas Social Science subjects such as humans or society (to give a \emph{clich{\'e}} exemple) are \emph{complex} in the sense of complex systems\footnote{for which no unified definition exists but of which fields of application range broadly from neuroscience to quantitative finance, incuding e.g. quantitative sociology, quantitative geography, integrative biology, etc.~\cite{newman2011complex}, and for which study various complementary approaches may be applied, such as Dynamical Systems, Agent-based Modeling, Random Matrix Theory}, thus a stronger need of a constructed theoretical (generally empirically based) framework to identify and define the objects of research that are necessarily more arbitrary in the framing of their boundaries, relations and processes. % ref on that claim ?
These differences in backgrounds are naturally desirable in the caleidogram of science, but things can get nasty when playing on ``common'' terrains, typically complex systems problematics as already detailed, as the exemple of geographical urban systems has recently shown~\cite{dupuy2015sciences}. Complex System Science\footnote{that we deliberately call that way} is seen by some as

\subsection*{Perspectives and Ontologies}

The starting point of the theory construction is a perspectivist epistemological approach on systems~\cite{giere2010scientific}.  To sum up, it interprets any scientific approach as a perspective, in which someone pursues some objective and uses what is called \emph{a model} to reach it. The model is nothing more than a scientific medium. Varenne developped~\cite{varenne2010framework} model typologies that can be interpreted as a refinment of this theory. Let for now relax this possible precision and use perspectives as proxies of the undefined objects and concepts. Indeed,
