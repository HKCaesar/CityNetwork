\section*{Introduction}

The structural misunderstandings between Social Sciences and Humanities on one side, and so-called Exact Sciences on the other side, far from being a generality, seems to have however a significant impact on the structure of scientific knowledge~\cite{2015arXiv151103981H}. In particular, the place of theory (and indeed the signification of this term itself) in the elaboration of knowledge has a totally different place, partly because of the different \emph{perceived complexities}\footnote{We used the term \emph{perceived} as most of systems studied by physics might be described as simple whereas they are intrinsically complex and indeed not well understood~\cite{laughlin2006different}.} of studied objects : for example, mathematical constructions and by extent theoretical physics are \emph{simple} in the sense that they are mostly entierely analytically solvable, whereas Social Science subjects such as humans or society (to give a \emph{clich{\'e}} exemple) are \emph{complex} in the sense of complex systems\footnote{for which no unified definition exists }.
