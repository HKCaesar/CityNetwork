\section{General Presentation}

\subsection{Context}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Scientific Context}
\vfill{}
\begin{justify}
Interactions between urban development and transportation network are considered to be central in dynamics of complex urban systems at any spatial and temporal scale~\cite{bretagnolle:tel-00459720}\cite{offner1993effets}. As many underlying time scales are involved in dynamics, very few modeling efforts have been done towards models simulating simultaneously both growths.\\
\vfill{}
Such geographical models would have both
\begin{itemize}
\item theoretical interest, in understanding processes involved in coevolution
\item direct practical applications (e.g. planning) in the case of partially data-driven models
\end{itemize}
\vfill{}

\subsection{Research Question}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Research Question}
\begin{justify}
\vfill{}
\textbf{Research question (current and very general, will necessarily evolve):}\bigskip

\textit{Are there some scale and level of thematic genericity at which it is possible to construct models of simulation aiming to couple urban and network growth ? To what extent can these models be data-driven in the aim of application to case studies ?}

\section{Technical Results}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Model Coupling}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\jframe{Model Coupling}{
Need for qualitative and quantitative considerations on modular model construction and validation $\rightarrow$ importance of model coupling.

\bigskip

Many literature on model construction : \\
iterative process in \cite{cottineau2015incremental}\\
towards a meta-model in \cite{goldspink2000modelling} ; etc.

\bigskip

Environments and formalisms for system integration (more from engineering backgroung) : \cite{golden2012modeling} ; DEVS formalism~\cite{zeigler1989devs}, or Object-Process Methodology~\cite{dori2002object}.

\jframe{Towards a Quantification of Model Coupling}{
\textit{Intuitive formulation}

\medskip

Let $M_1,M_2$ some models, $c(M_i)$ corresponding Kolmogorov complexity, $\alpha(M_i)$ model parameters, $o(M_i)$ models outputs, $\sim$ an equivalence relation between models.

\medskip

\textbf{Def : } $M$ couples (or extends) $M_1,M2$ if $\alpha(M_1)\cup\alpha(M_2)\subset\alpha(M)$ and $\exists \vec{\alpha}_1,\vec{\alpha}_2,\forall\vec{X},i, M[\vec{\alpha}_i,\vec{X}]\sim M_i[\vec{\alpha}_i|_{\alpha(M_i)},\vec{X}]$

\medskip

Given constraints on outputs $o(M)=o'$, it should be possible to define minimal coupling $<M_1\otimes M_2>$ as an equivalence class of models.

\medskip

\textit{Proposition of definitions of coupling strength :}\\
\textit{Computational coupling strength} : $\kappa_1 = \frac{c(M_1\otimes M_2)}{c(M_1)+c(M_2)}$\\
\textit{Functional coupling strength} : $\kappa_2 = d(o(M_1\otimes M_2),o(M_1)\cup o(M_2))$\\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\jframe{Algorithm Implementation}{
\textbf{Catalog Requests : } Mendeley API, easy to use and relatively open. \textit{Ongoing work : } Implement a Google scholar API to compare relative exhaustivities of catalogs.

\textbf{Natural Language Processing : } Procedure given in supplementary material of \cite{chavalarias2013phylomemetic} ; difficultly reproducible (!), so implemented web API to Cortext project website that provides the service online.

\textit{Wrapped as an executable program.} Allows distribution and tests by others (under acceptation of Cortext API) ; but also behavior exploration from external application (R in our case).
