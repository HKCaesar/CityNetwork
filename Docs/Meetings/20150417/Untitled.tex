\section{Technical Developments}


\jframe{NetLogoDoc}{
$\rightarrow$ Need for a systematic documentation of model, including internal implementation (generally not systematically vlidated).
\bigskip
Filter transforming NL code into intermediary java code, processed by \texttt{Doxygen}. Helps for architecture as analogy with classes has to be found (\texttt{.nls} correspond mainly to static classes in our convention).

\bigskip
TODO : release beta version for testing.

}

\jframe{Algo SR}{
Scholar API allows to retrieve citing references (only this sense).
\bigskip

$\rightarrow$ External validation of classification results for corpuses obtained through langage processing through study of clustering coefficients for 1st order backward citation network.

\bigskip

TODO : compute clustering coefs, finish paper ECTQG.

}


\jframe{Synthetic Data Control}{

Gibrat model, valid in first approximation~\cite{favaro2011gibrat}, used to generate macro-distribution of densities - strongly coupled with an heterogeneous diffusion model to obtain spatially distributed ``cities''.

}

\jframe{Synthetic Data Control}{
Currently being calibrated on real data (Greater Paris and London).

\bigskip

Identification of plausible parameter values, associated to different thematic regimes~\cite{duranton1999distance}

\bigskip

$\rightarrow$ Generation of stochastic datasets of synthetic macro-distribution for densities, on which one can control e.g. the transition from ``tyranny of distance'' to ``tyranny of land''. Use of these controls to study behavior of morphogenesis models that take macro density profiles as exogeneous variables.
}


\jframe{Governance}{

Original model in~\cite{lenechet2012} : LUTI model with the originality to have an evolving transportation network infrastructure, depending on a gouvernance structure.

\bigskip

Extension : test the effects of possible evolution of gouvernance structure (e.g. merge of communes). Can a polycentric metropolis emerge from the bottom-up ?

\bigskip

$\rightarrow$ Game-theory framework to express negociations between adjacent cities when building new infrastructures ; local rules for constructing and/or merging.

\bigskip

TODO : finish a functional implementation (to slow for now).

\textit{Abstract for ECTQG}

}


\jframe{Scaling}{

Based on~\cite{2013arXiv1301.1674A}, current work by C. Cottineau : phase diagrams of scaling parameter for different urban variables in the 2D space of morphological and functional threshold used to define boundaries of cities.

\bigskip

\textbf{Q : } Form of the phase diagram should contain structure of the urban system ? In particular relationship between form and function ?

\bigskip

\textbf{Current Work : } Formal derivation of the expression of the phase diagram for Gaussian Mixtures, to check if results are not structural.

\bigskip

TODO : Should be interesting to look at variation of phase diagram across varying geographical ragions (position and size), may confirm different mechanisms of systems of cities.
