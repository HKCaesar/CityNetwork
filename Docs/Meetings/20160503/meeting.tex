\section{Network Necessity}

\sframe{Network Necessity}{
\textbf{Simple toy models to test theoretical assumption of network necessity}

\medskip

$\rightarrow$ Extended Gibrat model for population growth within a city system (simplified Favaro-Pumain model or projected Cottineau-1.y.z model) with interactions. \textit{Idea :} Test if physical Network (feedback of physical flows) allows a better fit.

\medskip

\textbf{Rq. :} a lot of confusion on Gibrat Model :
\begin{enumerate}
\item Under classical independence assumptions, $Law(P)$ is known at any $t$ whatever the distribution of growth rates : no need to simulate).
\item Furthermore, various formulation are possible : independent realizations across cities of the same random process $P(t)$ with varying non-stationary parameters $\mu(t)$, with interdependence captured in recurrence relation between successive expectancies ; or multi-dimensional random process $(P_i(t))$ with covariance structure $\Covb{P_i}{P_j}$ estimated in time.
\end{enumerate}

\sframe{Empirical Results}{

\textit{Work on Pumain-INED French cities database.}

\medskip

\textbf{Growth Rates are more log-normal than normal ! } (simple likelihood tests) - in fact $\Delta \log P$ closer from levy fat-tail distribution.

\medskip

\textbf{Non-stationarity of correlations in time and space : }

\sframe{First Modeling Results}{

Interaction model with $\Eb{\vec{P} (t+1)}= (r_0\cdot \mathbf{Id}+\mathbf{R})\Eb{\vec{P}(t)}$, specified with gravity interactions $\left(\mathbf{R}[\cdot]\right)_{ij} = \frac{1}{V_0}\cdot\left(\frac{\Eb{P_j}\Eb{P_i}}{P^2}\right)^{\gamma}\cdot \exp{\left(-\frac{d_ij}{d_0}\right)}$ (note : taking $\gamma=1$ yields linear formulation).

}

\sframe{Methodological Issue}{

\textbf{Next step : } Introduce feedback terms due to effective physical flows passing through the city (in a first approximation only geographically computed with elevation data), test directly for network necessity. Fitting that model should also allow to quantify tunnel effect (strength of feedback).

\bigskip

\textbf{Methodological Flaw : } Issue with overfitting in models of simulations (seems to be an open question) : how do we know fit improvement is not only due to additional degree of freedom ? In stats : AIC provides Kullback-leibler information gain by correcting log-likelihood with number of parameters, nothing similar for models of simulation. Possible solutions :
\small
\begin{enumerate}
\item Empirical version of AIC : Brutal version with empirical likelihood ? Estimation of statistical models on parameter space of each model of simulation, use of corresponding AIC ?
\item Sparse non-linear machine learning to produce a kind of ``absolute'' benchmark explainable variance at a given number or parameters (rq : simple 2nd degree polynomial autoregressive model give far better results than two models above !)
\end{enumerate}
