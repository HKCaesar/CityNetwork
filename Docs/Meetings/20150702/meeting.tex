\jframe{Morphological Analysis : next steps}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Systematic study of clustering typology, find consistent cluster size reproducing known typology. Test various scales.
\item Analysis on LUZ to validate the method by reproducing Florent results.
\item Network data : street network and railways/public transports directly imported from OSM into R.
\item Network morphological analysis.
\item Coupled statistical analysis of network and urban form, systematically at varying scales [scale is key in our problem].

\jframe{Synthetic Data Control : On the utility of the approach}{
Context : Model $S$ sensitive to initial conditions $I$, that can be produced by an upstream model $U$. We propose to study the sensitivity of $S$ to $I$ by an exploration of $S\circ U$, allowing statistical control on $U$ parameters (let say $\alpha$) and a better knowledge of the differentiate of $S$.
\medskip
One can object : \textit{Coupling models adds complexity, we do not study the same models. Sensitivity of downstream model can be achieved by the exploration on a large set of $I$.}
\medskip
$\rightarrow$ precisely, one needs quickly a generative model to be able to explore a large number of configurations for $I$.
\medskip
$\rightarrow$ furthermore, even with a dimensionality reduction on $I$ (e.g. morphological classification), one will difficultly know components of its derivative. Whereas studying the coupling allows to know $\partial_{\alpha} I$ and thus $\partial_{I}S$, since $\partial_{\alpha}\left[S\circ U\right] = \partial_{\alpha}S \circ U \times \partial_{\alpha} U$.
\medskip
$\rightarrow$ We also tackle the overall stochastcity, since $\Eb{\Eb{S|I}}=\Eb{S}$.
