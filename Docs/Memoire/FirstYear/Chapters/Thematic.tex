This introductive chapter aims to set up the thematic scene, the geographical context in which further developments will root. It is not supposed to be understood as an exhaustive literature review nor the fundamental theoretical basement of our work (the first will be an object of chapter~\ref{ch:quantepistemo} whereas the second will be earlier tackled in chapter~\ref{ch:theory}), but more as narration aimed to introduce typical objects and views and construct naturally research questions.

\section{From Territories to Networks}


\paragraph{Human Territories}

The notion of territory can be taken as a basis to explore the scope of geographical objects we will study. In Ecology, a territory corresponds to a spatial extent occupied by a group of agents or more generally an ecosystem. \emph{Human Territories} are far more complex in the sense of semiotic representations of these that are a central part in the emergence of societies. For \noun{Raffestin} in~\cite{raffestin1988reperes}, the so-called \emph{Human Territoriality} is the ``conjonction of a territorial process with an informational process'', what means that physical occupation and exploitation of space by human societies is not dissociable from the representations (cognitive and material) of these territorial processes, driving in return its further evolutions. In other words, 

\paragraph{Towards a Territorial Theory of Networks}

We paraphrase \noun{Dupuy} in~\cite{dupuy1987vers} when he proposes elements for ``a territorial theory of networks'' based on the concrete case of Urban Transportation Networks. 


\noun{Raffestin} points out in his preface of~\cite{offner1996reseaux} that a geographical theory articulating space, network and territories had never been consistently formulated. It appears to still be the case today.
