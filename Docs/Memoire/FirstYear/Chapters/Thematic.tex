This introductive chapter aims to set up the thematic scene, the geographical context in which further developments will root. It is not supposed to be understood as an exhaustive literature review nor the fundamental theoretical basement of our work (the first will be an object of chapter~\ref{ch:quantepistemo} whereas the second will be earlier tackled in chapter~\ref{ch:theory}), but more as narration aimed to introduce typical objects and views and construct naturally research questions.

\section{From Territories to Networks and back}


\paragraph{Human Territories}

The notion of territory can be taken as a basis to explore the scope of geographical objects we will study. In Ecology, a territory corresponds to a spatial extent occupied by a group of agents or more generally an ecosystem. \emph{Human Territories} are far more complex in the sense of semiotic representations of these that are a central part in the emergence of societies. For \noun{Raffestin} in~\cite{raffestin1988reperes}, the so-called \emph{Human Territoriality} is the ``conjonction of a territorial process with an informational process'', what means that physical occupation and exploitation of space by human societies is not dissociable from the representations (cognitive and material) of these territorial processes, driving in return its further evolutions. In other words, 

\paragraph{Towards a Territorial Theory of Networks}

We paraphrase \noun{Dupuy} in~\cite{dupuy1987vers} when he proposes elements for ``a territorial theory of networks'' based on the concrete case of Urban Transportation Networks. 


\noun{Raffestin} points out in his preface of~\cite{offner1996reseaux} that a geographical theory articulating space, network and territories had never been consistently formulated. It appears to still be the case today.

\paragraph{Deconstructing Accessibility}

% critic of accessibility as a planning tool : danger of not taking into account socio-eco dynamics and coupled dynamics (coevol) - cit Hadri mobility as a constructed notion.


\paragraph{Scales and Hierarchies}

% here overview of different approaches
% TODO Q : do it here, not during quant epistemo part ?

\subsubsection{Land-Use Transportation Interaction Models}

A subsequent bunch of literature in modeling interaction between networks and territories can be found in the field of planning, with the so-called \emph{Land-use Transportation Interaction Models}. These works are difficult to be precisely bounded as they may be influenced by various disciplines. For example, from the point of view of Urban Economics, propositions for synthesizing models have existed for a relatively long term~\cite{putman1975urban}. The variety of possible models has lead to operational comparisons~\cite{paulley1991overview,wegener1991one}. More recently, the respective advantages of static and dynamic was investigated in~\cite{kryvobokov2013comparison}.

% differentiate to other hybrid models : SimpopNet and others ? (if exist ?)


\subsubsection{Network Growth}



\subsubsection{Hybrid Modeling}

Models of simulation implementing a coupled dynamic between urban growth and transportation network growth are relatively rare, and always rather poor from a theoretical and thematic point of view. A generalization of the geometrical local optimization model described before was developed in~\cite{barthelemy2009co}. % pb of scales, def of coevol, thematic meaning of assumptions, etc.
