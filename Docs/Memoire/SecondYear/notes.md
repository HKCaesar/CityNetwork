## On computational reproducibility

*Jeu 25 aoÃ» 2016 10:28:58 CEST*

Beware of full computational reproc, very different from only code sharing (cf languageABM project).
\cite{2016arXiv160806897H} describes well this issue. including data sharing, closed system use, etc. 
 -> be more nuanced on reproducibility
Open/repro : open review using pull reqs etc on a dedicated repo. : transparency of the sci process ?
