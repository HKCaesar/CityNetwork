## Modularity

*Mar 29 nov 2016 12:46:14 CST*

\cite{2015arXiv150402550T}
Theoretical ecology without species : link with modularity in territorial systems ? (interaction matrix, etc.) -> on the arbitrary of partitions


## General positioning

*Dim 27 nov 2016 17:27:36 CST*

paper Batty : CA, ABM, meso scale growth models : \cite{batty2005agents}



## Network Growth

*Mer 16 nov 2016 16:18:17 CST*

 Paper betweeness centrality random planar graph : check growth model / how close to meso heursitics ?



## Misc

* Jeu 29 sep 2016 17:35:53 CEST * [ideas from 28/09]

  - put Raffestin human territories in the perspective of Production of Space by Lefebvre
  - Extension : application of theory to all models presented
  - Extension : application of the meta-theory to the full approach
  - perspectives on CS -- evidence-based
  - Model faminly for co-evolution : transport at a greater scale than the city but with endogenous times (transportation projects)



## Misc

* Jeu 29 sep 2016 07:34:19 CEST *

  - model Charlotte : link with Gibrat-Simon. // paper Langevin : crazy if fundamental but GOOD (not as Barthelemy) mechanism reproduces stylized facts
  - on Open Review : detail process in appendix
  - rq : put graphs, stats etc : the best would be a shiny appli for each model -> integrated platform : cf Seb !
  - papers/com : map in time/thematic space ?


## Theory construction

* Mer 14 sep 2016 19:29:06 CEST *

Hall and Pain Mega City Regions : Chapter 2-3 : "bring together four sets of conceptual insights"
-> theory mixing or construction ? compare with our theory and the syncretism critics it can receive


## Cybernetics and cities

* Jeu  8 sep 2016 23:57:57 CEST *

paper Gerhenson/Ratti -> link cybernetics/CS ? autonmoous vehicle : compare tarnsportation point of view ewgt
is that a theory ? links/compatibility ? etc



## Early-warning time-series statistical tests

* Ven  2 sep 2016 12:38:32 CEST*

cf pnas article on neolithic populations (TimeSeries)






## On computational reproducibility

*Jeu 25 aoû 2016 10:28:58 CEST*

Beware of full computational reproc, very different from only code sharing (cf languageABM project).
\cite{2016arXiv160806897H} describes well this issue. including data sharing, closed system use, etc.
 -> be more nuanced on reproducibility
Open/repro : open review using pull reqs etc on a dedicated repo. : transparency of the sci process ?
