* Lun 23 jan 2017 11:04:16 CET * 

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.05114v1.pdf (in ToSort) -> linking general relativity with economic trajectories : // idée of geographical space as reativistic space ? // REVUE Paper L'Hostis : diffeomorphismes : seeing deformed space as relativistic ?



## Reproducibility

A manifesto for reproducible science, ... et Ioannidis



## City definition

* Jeu  5 jan 2017 18:30:06 CST *

when writing on morphogenesis, boundaries -> def city boundaries, i;e. def the city object, is still an open question..(cf Clem scaling ; rq Batty CCS) to what extent our theory of territorial systems gives an answer ; allows to "sortir par le haut" ? (or not ?)


## Morphogenesis

* Mar  3 jan 2017 18:20:54 CST * 

 - Alan Turing's Drawings, Autopoiesis and Can Buildings Think? : presence of morphogenetic processes (autpoietic ?) in design of buildings (need more)
 - on autopoiesis and cognition : Autopoiesis with or without cognition: defining life at its edge



## Misc

* Ven 30 déc 2016 12:27:42 CST *

 - disc. Cinzia on territorial integration / abberations of frnech network (railway or freeways) -> good narrative of how such a strongly coupled system is path-dependent

 - Transportation Equilibrium : FRIES 1985 gives theoretical approach to equilibria and network design -> possibly link TrEq part with nw morphogenesis ?






## On theory

* Jeu 29 déc 2016 13:05:51 CST *

do a short link with Tobler, laws etc. : morphogenesis : when bound conditions are either not necessary to explain patterns, or do not modify too much quantitative fit.

## Misc

* Jeu 29 sep 2016 17:35:53 CEST * [ideas from 28/09]

  - put Raffestin human territories in the perspective of Production of Space by Lefebvre
  - Extension : application of theory to all models presented
  - Extension : application of the meta-theory to the full approach
  - perspectives on CS -- evidence-based
  - Model faminly for co-evolution : transport at a greater scale than the city but with endogenous times (transportation projects)



## Misc

* Jeu 29 sep 2016 07:34:19 CEST *

  - model Charlotte : link with Gibrat-Simon. // paper Langevin : crazy if fundamental but GOOD (not as Barthelemy) mechanism reproduces stylized facts
  - on Open Review : detail process in appendix
  - rq : put graphs, stats etc : the best would be a shiny appli for each model -> integrated platform : cf Seb !
  - papers/com : map in time/thematic space ?


## Theory construction

* Mer 14 sep 2016 19:29:06 CEST *

Hall and Pain Mega City Regions : Chapter 2-3 : "bring together four sets of conceptual insights"
-> theory mixing or construction ? compare with our theory and the syncretism critics it can receive


## Cybernetics and cities

* Jeu  8 sep 2016 23:57:57 CEST *

paper Gerhenson/Ratti -> link cybernetics/CS ? autonmoous vehicle : compare tarnsportation point of view ewgt
is that a theory ? links/compatibility ? etc



## Early-warning time-series statistical tests

* Ven  2 sep 2016 12:38:32 CEST*

cf pnas article on neolithic populations (TimeSeries)






## On computational reproducibility

*Jeu 25 aoû 2016 10:28:58 CEST*

Beware of full computational reproc, very different from only code sharing (cf languageABM project).
\cite{2016arXiv160806897H} describes well this issue. including data sharing, closed system use, etc.
 -> be more nuanced on reproducibility
Open/repro : open review using pull reqs etc on a dedicated repo. : transparency of the sci process ?
