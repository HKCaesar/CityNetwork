Hall and Pain Mega City Regions : Chapter 2-3 : "bring together four sets of conceptual insights"
-> theory mixing or construction ? compare with our theory and the syncretism critics it can receive

paper Gerhenson/Ratti -> link cybernetics/CS ? autonmoous vehicle : compare tarnsportation point of view ewgt
is that a theory ? links/compatibility ? etc

## On computational reproducibility

*Jeu 25 aoÃ» 2016 10:28:58 CEST*

Beware of full computational reproc, very different from only code sharing (cf languageABM project).
\cite{2016arXiv160806897H} describes well this issue. including data sharing, closed system use, etc. 
 -> be more nuanced on reproducibility
Open/repro : open review using pull reqs etc on a dedicated repo. : transparency of the sci process ?
