\ctparttext{This part set up foundations, constructing our research precise subject and questions from a thematic point of view, completed with a theoretical construction for framing at thematic and epistemological levels. We also provide methodological digressions, and a quantitative epistemological analysis completing the manual state of the art.}

\ctparttext{This part aims at producing knowledge from the empirical analysis of case studies and from first modeling experiments. Explicit testing of hypothesis drawn from the theory is not achieved yet as these are preliminary steps for a reasoned insight into empirical and modeling domains.} % Text on the Part 2 page describing the content in Part 2


% Part II : Empirical analysis / Toy-modeling
% TODO : part 2 should set up the elementary bricks for further work ?

\ctparttext{This concluding remark, for now a brief roadmap, is one objective of our thesis as implementation of our theory ans thus is expected to become a consequent part. We conclude here this preliminary work by perspectives and roadmap. This part make the synthesis of what was build until now, towards a delicate though robust edifice.}

\part{Synthesis}


%  A family of dynamic models : develop aim.

%------------------------------------------------

\ctparttext{A building is never used the way it was designed, that is a reality which grasping makes the difference between good and excellent architects. The effective functional use give sense to any construction. So goes it for a knowledge edifice. We shall now take a look back on what we constructed and try to take a step back. This part develops first theoretical apparels emerging from the various aspects already tackled. It then proposes to extract fundamental open questions that future research on territorial complex systems will have to tackle in the incoming decades.}
