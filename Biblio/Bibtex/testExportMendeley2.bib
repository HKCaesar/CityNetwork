abstract = {Atmospheric flow and pollutant dispersion over built-up areas are affected by phenomena occurring at different scales. Hence, scale interactions should also be considered in the mathematical modelling of atmospheric flow and pollutant dispersion. In this paper a method is presented to couple prognostic mesoscale and microscale flow models. Results from mesoscale simulations are used to generate the initial state and boundary conditions for microscale simulations. The method comprises a three-dimensional interpolation scheme and a vertical adjustment of the interpolated quantities in the surface layer based on similarity theory. The method is applied to couple the microscale model MIMO with the mesoscale model MEMO. The coupled system MEMO-MIMO is applied to simulate the local scale flow for an industrial area in southwestern Germany. Model results are presented and compared with available measurements.

abstract = {This paper reviews the numerous and various applications of the SLEUTH urban growth model over the last decade. SLEUTH is a Cellular Automaton-based urban growth model that uses historical geospatial data for calibration of its parameters. Applications have covered the major cities of the United States, including Detroit, Chicago, New York, Washington, San Francisco and Albuquerque. The model has also been applied in the Netherlands, Portugal, South America, Africa and Australia. Applications have examined the likelihood of urban encroachment on waste disposal sites, the generation of planning scenarios for public decision-making, and the expansion of informal settlements in Yaound\'{e}, Cameroon. Regions covered have varied from a single small town to a whole multi-city urban region, and spatial resolutions have gone from tens of meters to kilometers. The paper assembles for the first time the calibration results from the model applications, and attempts an inter-city comparison, expanding on Silva's concept of the DNA of regions. This is possible because the successful calibration of the SLEUTH model from historical land use data gives a set of five parameters that capture the nature of the urban growth in a region. The discussion also summarizes the various lessons learned, especially in how to best calibrate the model. Recent results have shown not only that model performance can be significantly improved using high performance computing, but also that adaptations are possible for searching the parameter space that vastly improve how well the model forecasts growth and change into the future.},

abstract = {Urban street patterns form planar networks whose empirical properties cannot be accounted for by simple models such as regular grids or Voronoi tesselations. Striking statistical regularities across different cities have been recently empirically found, suggesting that a general and detail-independent mechanism may be in action. We propose a simple model based on a local optimization process combined with ideas previously proposed in studies of leaf pattern formation. The statistical properties of this model are in good agreement with the observed empirical patterns. Our results thus suggest that in the absence of a global design strategy, the evolution of many different transportation networks indeed follows a simple universal mechanism.},

In this paper, the author considers six cases of urban street networks characterized by different patterns and historical roots. The authors propose a representation of the street networks based firstly on a primal graph, where intersections are turned into nodes and streets into edges. In a second step, a dual graph, where streets are nodes and intersections are edges, is constructed by means of a generalization model named Intersection Continuity Negotiation, which allows to acknowledge the continuity of streets over a plurality of edges. Finally, the authors address a comparative study of some structural properties of the dual graphs, seeking significant similarities among clusters of cases. A wide set of network analysis techniques are implemented over the dual graph: in particular the authors show that the absence of any clue of assortativity differentiates urban street networks from other non-geographic systems and that most of the considered networks have a broad degree distribution typical of scale-free networks and exhibit small-world properties as well.},

@article{andersson2006complex,
abstract = {Economic geography can be viewed as a large and growing network of interacting activities. This fundamental network structure and the large size of such systems makes the complex network approach an attractive model for growth dynamics modeling. In this paper the authors propose the use of complex networks for geographical modeling and demonstrate how such an application can be combined with a cellular model to produce output that is consistent with large-scale regularities such as power laws and fractality. Complex networks can provide a stringent framework for growth dynamic modeling where concepts from, for example, spatial interaction models and multiplicative growth models, can be combined with the flexible representation of land and behaviour found in cellular automata and agent-based models. In addition, there exists a large body of theory for the analysis of complex networks that have direct applications in urban geographic problems. The intended use of such models is twofold: (1) to address the problem of how the empirically observed hierarchical structure of settlements can be explained as a stationary property of a stochastic evolutionary process rather than as equilibrium points in a dynamic process, and, (2) to improve the predictive quality of applied urban modeling.},

abstract = {Transport systems and land use are two mutually interconnected elements: the location of the activities and their need for interactions produce transport demand; on the other hand, transport supply system supporting transport demand and performance levels of transport services affect the activity locations. In this paper the relationship among the factors affecting transportation and land-use systems interactions was investigated and a GIS was used for exploring the relationship among some spatial variables regarding geographical features, activity location, demographic and economic characteristics, and transportation variables such as trip production and attraction, and accessibility. Analysing the relationship among the variables, unobserved or “latent” variables affecting land-use and transport interactions were identified and introduced in a structural equation model. This approach allows the modelling of a phenomenon by considering both unobserved “latent” constructs and observed indicators describing the phenomenon. The results show that travel behaviour is more influenced by the economic characteristics of population. These analyses allow identifying the relationships among variables related to land use and transportation system, and can provide some findings for transportation planners as well as assisting the complex process of urban planning decision-making.},

It aims to disentangle the ‘chicken and egg’ problem of which came first, network or land development, through a set of statistical analyses clearly distinguishing events by order. Using panel data representing the 33 boroughs of London over each decade from 1871 to 2001, the research finds that there is a positive feedback effect between population density and network density. Additional rail stations (either Underground or surface) are positive factors leading to subsequent increases in population in the suburbs of London, while additional population density is a factor in subsequently deploying more rail. These effects differ in central London, where the additional accessibility produced by rail led to commercial development and concomitant depopulation. There are also differences in the effects associated with surface rail stations and Underground stations, as the Underground was able to get into central London in a way that surface rail could not. However, the two networks were weak (and statistically insignificant) substitutes for each other in the suburbs, while the density of surface rail stations was a complement to the Underground in the center, though not vice versa.},

We use a simple model of formation and evolution of city roads which reproduces the most important empirical features of street networks in cities. Within this framework, we explicitely introduce the topology of the road network and analyze how it evolves and interact with the evolution of population density. We show that accessibility issues -pushing individuals to get closer to high centrality nodes- lead to high density regions and the appearance of densely populated centers. In particular, this model reproduces the empirical fact that the density profile decreases exponentially from a core district. In this simplified model, the size of the core district depends on the relative importance of transportation and rent costs.},

abstract = {Plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a single cell visible by unaided eye. During its foraging behaviour the cell spans spatially distributed sources of nutrients with a protoplasmic network. Geometrical structure of the protoplasmic networks allows the plasmodium to optimize transfer of nutrients between remote parts of its body, to distributively sense its environment, and make a decentralized decision about further routes of migration. We consider the ten most populated urban areas in United Kingdom and study what would be an optimal layout of transport links between these urban areas from the "plasmodium's point of view". We represent geographical locations of urban areas by oat flakes, inoculate the plasmodium in Greater London area and analyse the plasmodium's foraging behaviour. We simulate the behaviour of the plasmodium using a particle collective which responds to the environmental conditions to construct and minimise transport networks. Results of our scoping experiments show that during its colonization of the experimental space the plasmodium forms a protoplasmic network isomorphic to a network of major motorways except the motorway linking England with Scotland. We also imitate the reaction of transport network to disastrous events and show how the transport network can be reconfigured during natural or artificial cataclysms. The results of the present research lay a basis for future science of bio-inspired urban and road planning.},

De nombreux auteurs ont point\{\'{e}\} du doigt l'\{\'{e}\}talement urbain et propos\{\'{e}\} une ville compacte et dense, mettant en avant le fait qu'elle (i) favorise l'utilisation des transports publics, (ii) permet une bonne accessibilit\{\'{e}\} aux commerces et services et (iii) r\{\'{e}\}duit la s\{\'{e}\}gr\{\'{e}\}gation sociale (Dantzig et Saaty, 1973). D'autres (Banister, 1992 ; Breheny, 1992, 1997 ; Owens, 1992) ont par contre \{\'{e}\}mit des doutes sur l'efficacit\{\'{e}\} de ces politiques en montrant que la ville compacte a souvent pour corollaire (i) une hausse des prix fonciers, (ii) une augmentation de la congestion des axes routiers et (iii) une r\{\'{e}\}duction de l'acc\{\`{e}\}s aux espaces verts et naturels. De m\{\^{e}\}me, l'impact de la ville dense sur la g\{\'{e}\}n\{\'{e}\}ration de trafic est \{\`{a}\} nuancer (Pouyanne, 1995 ; Dupuy, 2002) et doit \{\^{e}\}tre mis en perspective avec les propositions innovantes du New urbanism (Calthorpe, 1993).

La question qui se pose est d'anticiper les cons\{\'{e}\}quences de ces trois cas de figure tr\{\`{e}\}s contrast\{\'{e}\}s pour \{\'{e}\}clairer la prise de d\{\'{e}\}cision en am\{\'{e}\}nagement. Pour ce faire, nous avons recours \{\`{a}\} la mod\{\'{e}\}lisation informatique : le mod\{\`{e}\}le MobiSim qui s'apparente aux mod\{\`{e}\}les LUTI (Land-use and transport integrated ; Wegener, 2004) se fonde sur une approche individu-centr\{\'{e}\}e (agent-based).

Les r\{\'{e}\}sultats obtenus pour la France et les Etats-Unis r\{\'{e}\}v\{\`{e}\}lent l'impact du choix des d\{\'{e}\}limitations sur les mesures du poids ou de la croissance des villes, et nous proposons des pistes pour construire des bases de donn\{\'{e}\}es harmonis\{\'{e}\}es pour les villes d'Europe. Dans la derni\{\`{e}\}re partie, nous montrons que les grandes phases de transformation des syst\{\`{e}\}mes de villes co\{\"{\i}\}ncident avec des innovations technologiques majeures dans les transports, m\{\^{e}\}me si des facteurs politiques et sociaux interviennent aussi (l'appr\{\'{e}\}hension de territoires � nationaux �, la perception d'un espace de plus en plus relativis\{\'{e}\} par la vitesse de d\{\'{e}\}placement). Dans les effets de dimensionnement des territoires par les r\{\'{e}\}seaux rapides, nous soulignons l'importance d'un \{\'{e}\}chelon r\{\'{e}\}gional, permettant, par des actions d'am\{\'{e}\}nagement de grande ampleur, une structuration en r\{\'{e}\}seau des zones centrales de l'\{\'{e}\}conomie-monde. Par des mesures d'accessibilit\{\'{e}\} et de forme des r\{\'{e}\}seaux, nous mettons en \{\'{e}\}vidence des processus historiques d'adaptation mutuelle puis de co-\{\'{e}\}volution entre r\{\'{e}\}seaux de transport et trame urbaine. Dans la phase de co-\{\'{e}\}volution, nous observons une diff\{\'{e}\}renciation croissante des positions relatives des lieux qui explique pour partie le processus de hi\{\'{e}\}rarchisation des tailles de villes observable tant en Europe qu'aux Etats-Unis.},

abstract = {A two-way interaction between transport and land-use has been one of the central research topics of transport studies. Thus, it is not surprising that there have been numerous approaches taken to investigate this reciprocal relationship. This paper critically examines the existing literature to see how effectively the current models represent this mutual interaction. This examination process intends to form a prototype reference that compares and contrasts the advantages and disadvantages of the various models. This undertaking is dealt with based on theoretical, methodological and operational characteris- tics of a respective model. Some conclusions and suggestions are also drawn.},

abstract = {Modern urban regions are highly complex entities. Despite the difficulty of modeling every relevant aspect of an urban region, researchers have produced a rich variety of models dealing with interrelated processes of urban change. The most popular types of models have been those dealing with the relationship between transportation network growth and changes in land use and the location of economic activity, embodied in the concept of accessibility. This article reviews some of the more common frameworks for modeling transportation and land use change, illustrating each with some examples of operational models that have been applied to real-world settings. It then identifies new directions for future research in urban modeling and notes the important contributions of the field to date.},

abstract = {Today, our cities are an embodiment of the complex, historical evolution of knowledge, desires and technology. Our planned and designed activities co-evolve with our aspirations, mediated by the existing technologies and social structures. The city represents the accretion and accumulation of successive layers of collective activity, structuring and being structured by other, increasingly distant cities, reaching now right around the globe. This historical and structural development cannot therefore be understood or captured by any set of fixed quantitative relations. Structural changes imply that the patterns of growth, and their underlying reasons change over time, and therefore that any attempt to control the morphology of cities and their patterns of flow by means of planning and design, must be dynamical, based on the mechanisms that drive the changes occurring at a given moment. This carefully edited post-proceedings volume gathers a snapshot view by leading researchers in field, of current complexity theories of cities. In it, the achievements, criticisms and potentials yet to be realized are reviewed and the implications to planning and urban design are assessed.},

@article{reuillon2013openmole,
abstract = {Complex-systems describe multiple levels of collective structure and organization. In such systems, the emergence of global behaviour from local interactions is generally studied through large scale experiments on numerical models. This analysis generates important computation loads which require the use of multi-core servers, clusters or grid computing. Dealing with such large scale executions is especially challenging for modellers who do not possess the theoretical and methodological skills required to take advantage of high performance computing environments. That is why we have designed a cloud approach for model experimentation. This approach has been implemented in OpenMOLE (Open MOdeL Experiment) as a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that leverages the naturally parallel aspect of model experiments. The OpenMOLE DSL has been designed to explore user-supplied models. It delegates transparently their numerous executions to remote execution environment. From a user perspective, those environments are viewed as services providing computing power, therefore no technical detail is ever exposed. This paper presents the OpenMOLE DSL through the example of a toy model exploration and through the automated calibration of a real-world complex-system model in the field of geography. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Transport networks are ubiquitous in both social and biological systems. Robust network performance involves a complex trade-off involving cost, transport efficiency, and fault tolerance. Biological networks have been honed by many cycles of evolutionary selection pressure and are likely to yield reasonable solutions to such combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, they develop without centralized control and may represent a readily scalable solution for growing networks in general. We show that the slime mold Physarum polycephalum forms networks with comparable efficiency, fault tolerance, and cost to those of real-world infrastructure networks--in this case, the Tokyo rail system. The core mechanisms needed for adaptive network formation can be captured in a biologically inspired mathematical model that may be useful to guide network construction in other domains.},
