AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether neighbourhood level socioeconomic variables have an independent effect on reported child behaviour problems over and above the effect of individual level measures of socioeconomic status. DESIGN AND SETTING: Multilevel analysis of cross sectional survey data relating individual level child behavioural problems and parental measures of socioeconomic status with neighbourhood level measures of socioeconomic deprivation in the city of Maastricht, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Children born in the years 1990-1991 attending the second grade of normal kindergarten schools in the city of Maastricht, the Netherlands. Out of 1417 eligible 5-7 year olds, the parents of 734 children (51.8%) agreed to participate. MAIN RESULTS: Child behaviour problems were more frequent in families of low parental occupation and education (F=14.51, df 3, 721, p<0.001; F=12.20, df 3, 721, p<0.001, respectively) and in families living in deprived neighbourhoods (F=13.26, df 2, 722, p<0.001). Multilevel random effects regression analysis showed that the effect of neighbourhood level deprivation remained after adjustment for individual level socioeconomic status (B over three levels of deprivation: 1.36; 95%CI=0.28, 2.45). CONCLUSIONS: Living in a more deprived neighbourhood is associated with higher levels of child problem behaviour, irrespective of individual level socioeconomic status. The additional effect of the neighbourhood may be attributable to contextual variables such as the level of social cohesion among residents.

AB  - In this paper, we use the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth data to examine the links between child well-being and neighbourhood 'quality.' This study adds to the literature by (i) investigating the relationship between neighbourhood quality and child health, (ii) by utilizing subjective assessments by individuals familiar with the neighbourhood (i.e., the survey respondent and interviewer), and (iii) by utilizing multiple assessments of neighbourhood quality, and (iv) by investigating several measures of health. Other work has found that controlling for family level characteristics reduces or eliminates the apparent association between neighbourhood quality and health. We find, measuring both child well-being and neighbourhood quality multi-dimensionally, that even after controlling for family level characteristics neighbourhood quality has strong associations with child well-being.

AB  - Arguments about sustainable urban form have generally been in normative terms without recourse to its practicality. The paper shows that the essential elements of urban form are outcomes of real estate markets. The focus of the research is to examine the economic sustainability constraints to the adaptation of the existing urban form via housing market development viability. To address the task a number of econometric models are linked together to estimate spatial patterns of viability in five cities. The results demonstrate a substantial difference between cities that can be attributed not to urban form per se but to socioeconomic factors. This demonstrates that in practice it is impossible to divorce the physical structure of cities from their economic and social structure. Viability is also influenced strongly by public policy through the location of social housing. The research suggests that a driving force/constraint for development viability is the level of neighbourhood house prices. Large swathes of negative viability are found even without accounting for the additional costs of brownfield development, suggesting that there are major constraints to the reconfiguration of housing markets in some cities in a piecemeal way.

AB  - One aspect of greenways which is exciting popular interest in the US is the durability of nineteenth-century parkways and park systems to stitch together fragmenting cities and urbanizing areas. What the Olmsteds, Cleveland, Eliot and Kessler achieved in their regional open-space plans can be the model for a new version of Howard’s ‘town/country’ in which greenways/ greenbelts/greenspaces together make a comprehensive ‘green’ infrastructure. Some of the literature and the highlights of historic greenway planning and design in the US are reviewed. Their adaptation to current projects is illustrated through a series of case studies of gradually increasing scale-villages, towns, cities and regions. Such common strategies as ‘green’ streets, parks and playgrounds structuring walkable neighborhoods, intra-neighborhood parkways connecting town/city districts, and regional park systems protecting natural areas for recreation/conservation still confer similar social, economic and environmental benefits. Whether Pedestrian Pockets or Co-housing, expanding historic settlements or preserving the countryside, planning new ‘urban villages’ or neo-traditional towns, greenways can be powerful makers and shapers of urban form at both macro- and micro-scales.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although socio-economic factors have been identified as one of the most important groups of neighbourhood-level risks affecting birth outcomes, uncertainties still exist concerning the pathways through which they are transferred to individual risk factors. This poses a challenge for setting priorities and developing appropriate community-oriented public health interventions and planning guidelines to reduce the level of adverse birth outcomes.\n\nMETHOD: This study examines potential direct and mediated pathways through which neighbourhood-level socio-economic determinants exert their impacts on adverse birth outcomes. Two hypothesized models, namely the materialist and psycho-social models, and their corresponding pathways are tested using a binary-outcome multilevel mediation analysis. Live birth data, including adverse birth outcomes and person-level exposure variables, were obtained from three public health units in the province of Ontario, Canada. Corresponding neighbourhood-level socio-economic, psycho-social and living condition variables were extracted or constructed from the 2001 Canadian Census and the first three cycles (2001, 2003, and 2005) of the Canadian Community Health Surveys.\n\nRESULTS: Neighbourhood-level socio-economic-related risks are found to have direct effects on low birth weight and preterm birth. In addition, 20-30% of the total effects are contributed by indirect effects mediated through person-level risks. There is evidence of four person-level pathways, namely through individual socio-economic status, psycho-social stress, maternal health, and health behaviours, with all being simultaneously at work. Psycho-social pathways and buffering social capital-related variables are found to have more impact on low birth weight than on preterm birth.\n\nCONCLUSION: The evidence supports both the materialist and psycho-social conceptualizations and the pathways that describe them, although the magnitude of the former is greater than the latter.

The objective of this research is to contribute to the development of a standardized method for analysis, so that material and energy consumption can be quantified. Analyzing the resource consumption of the built environment is particularly relevant in cities that are rapidly growing, as short-term planning decisions will have long-term consequences for both the quality of life of the inhabitants, and the future energy and material use of the urban area.

AB  - Measuring and characterizing urban form is an important task for planners and policy analysts. This paper compares eighteen metrics of urban form for 542 neighborhoods in Salt Lake County, Utah. The comparison was made in the context of characterizing three neighborhood types from different time periods: pre-suburban (1891-1944), suburban (1945-1990), and late-suburban (1990-2007). We used correlation analysis, within and across time periods, to assess each metric's ability to uniquely characterize urban form; and we used linear regression to assess the ability to distinguish neighborhood type. Three of the metrics show redundancy and two did not capture differences in urban form for the case study. Based on our findings, we recommend thirteen of the eighteen metrics for planners and policy analysts who want to quantify urban form using spatial data that are commonly available. Furthermore, our case study shows that despite policy efforts to encourage "smart growth," urban neighborhoods in Salt Lake County continue to exhibit characteristics of "sprawl." These findings suggest the effectiveness of smart growth policies in Salt Lake County have had limited effect. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: The effects of family and place on health outcomes may be seriously misestimated by standard analytic techniques. The information-rich settings in several Canadian provinces can provide appropriate designs to minimize biases resulting from omitted variables and measurement error. This paper compares siblings with children living in the same neighbourhood (but not in the same family) in terms of health care utilization and health care costs. A complete history of residential mobility since birth permits an estimate of the effects of exposure to different environments. Methods: Registry data from a Manitoba cohort born between 1978 and 1985 and continuously resident in the province generated a large sample of same-sex siblings and neighbours (N = 18,280). Administrative information on physician billings, hospital inpatient stays, and costs provided data on utilization between ages 12 and 17. Results: Large effects on the outcome variables were associated with being in the same family (correlations up to 0.50), whereas the correlations representing upper limits on neighbourhood effects were usually small. These neighbourhood correlations typically shrank slightly after adjustment for family effects. Higher neighbour correlations with utilization (particularly ambulatory visits) occurred in rural Manitoba and probably reflect variation in access to care. Higher correlations are associated with relatively small neighbourhoods and with families remaining in the neighbourhood for at least 17 years. Discussion: Although specific variables taken from administrative data are only marginally predictive, our results emphasize the importance of "family" in affecting health care utilization in Manitoba. The minimal effects of neighbourhood differ from those found by investigators generally using weaker designs and emphasizing the significance of neighbourhood.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The effectiveness of vaccines in populations must consider both direct and indirect protection. This study reanalyses data from a large individually randomized oral cholera vaccine trial that was conducted in rural Bangladesh from 1985 to 1990. A recent analysis of the results of that trial showed that the proportion of people in household clusters who received the vaccine was inversely related to placebo incidence during the first year of surveillance, which was attributed to herd immunity. METHODS: In this study we measure the relationship between neighbourhood-level oral cholera vaccine coverage and protective efficacy (PE) during a 2 year follow-up period, controlling for known effect modifiers. We link trial data to a household geographic information system to facilitate the neighbourhood-level analysis. Findings Neighbourhood-level PE can be partially explained by vaccine coverage after adjusting for ecological variables. CONCLUSIONS: The inverse relationship between vaccine coverage and efficacy illustrates that people living in high-coverage areas may be indirectly protected from cholera because people living around them are vaccinated.

AB  - This paper examines psychometric properties of scores derived from calibration curves (overconfidence, calibration, resolution, and slope) and an analogue of overconfidence that is based on a post-test estimate of the proportion of correctly solved items. Four tests from the theory of fluid and crystallized intelligence were used, and two of these tests employed both sequential and simultaneous methods of item presentation. The results indicate that the overconfidence score not only has the highest reliability, but is the only score with a reliability normally considered adequate for use in individual differences research. There is some, albeit weak, difference in subjects' level of overconfidence between sequential and simultaneous methods of item presentation. Correlational evidence confirms our previous findings that overconfidence scores from perceptual and 'knowledge' tasks define the same factor. In agreement with the results of Gigerenzer, Hoffrage and Kleinbolting (1991), subjects' post-test estimates of their performance showed lower levels of overconfidence than did the traditional measures based on subjects' confidence judgment responses to individual items. Also, after controlling for the actual test performances, the post-test performance estimates and average confidence ratings were only slightly positively correlated, suggesting that different psychological processes may underlie these two measures. Finally, our results suggest that average confidence over all items in the test may be a more useful measure in individual differences research than scores derived from calibration curves.

AB  - Study objective: To investigate the relation between neighbourhood socioeconomic and ethnic characteristics with depressive symptoms in a population based sample.  Design: Cross sectional data from the CARDIA study, including the Center for Epidemiological Studies depression scale score (CES-D). Neighbourhoods were 1990 US census blocks of 1000 people; six census variables reflecting wealth/income, education, and occupation investigated separately and as a summary score; neighbourhood racial composition (percentage white and black) and individual level income and education were also examined.  Setting: Participants recruited in 1985/86 from community lists in Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis MN; from a health plan in Oakland, CA.  Participants: 3437 adults aged 28–40 years in 1995/96: 24% white men, 27% white women, 20% black men, 29% black women.  Main results: For each race-sex group, CES-D was inversely related to neighbourhood score and individual income and education. Associations of neighbourhood score with CES-D became weak and inconsistent after adjusting for individual level factors; personal income remained strongly and inversely associated with CES-D. Age adjusted mean differences (standard errors) in CES-D between the lowest and highest income categories were 3.41 (0.62) for white men, 4.57 (0.64) for white women, 5.80 (0.87) for black men, and 5.74 (0.83) for black women. For both black and white participants, CES-D was associated negatively with percentage of white people and positively with percentage of black people in their census block, before, but not after, adjustment for individual and neighbourhood socioeconomic variables.  Conclusions: Neither neighbourhood socioeconomic characteristics nor ethnic density were consistently related to depressive symptoms once individual socioeconomic characteristics were taken into account.

The article then identifies a number of diagnostic and methodological issues to take into account when analysing neighbourhood effects.

The ultimate goal of neighbourhood effects research is not only to identify which mechanisms are responsible for neighbourhood effects, but also to quantitatively ascertain their relative contributions to the outcome under investigation. A pharmacological metaphor of “dosage-response” is used to understand how the theoretical mechanisms could be causally linked to individual outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study, in a geographically defined area, associations between the neighbourhood social environment and individual socioeconomic status on the one hand, and treated incidence of schizophrenia and level of subsequent service use on the other. METHOD: A combined data set of (i) patients with a case register diagnosis of schizophrenia and (ii) population controls was subjected to multilevel analyses, including neighbourhood exposures (neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage and social capital) and individual level confounders. Separate analyses were conducted for inpatient and outpatient psychiatric service consumption as indexed by the case register. RESULTS: Neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage and neighbourhood social capital did not impact on the treated incidence of schizophrenia, but quantity of inpatient service consumption was higher in neighbourhoods with higher level of social control (i.e. where it is more likely that neighbours intervene in neighbourhood-threatening situations). In addition, most indicators of lower individual socioeconomic status were associated with higher treated incidence, while treated incidence was lower when individual educational status was low. CONCLUSION: Residents of high social control neighbourhoods may seek greater levels of resolution of psychiatric disorder in patient-residents, and by consequence may induce greater levels of inpatient service consumption in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Individual-level indicators of social disadvantage are associated with higher risk of treated psychotic disorder, with the exception of lower educational status, which may confer a lower probability of treatment given the presence of psychotic disorder.

Collective well-being and distress were predictors of adolescent esteem in the presence of theoretically important student characteristics. The relationship of social climate to variability of esteem suggests that a positive climate may reduce individual differences within the school.

A new econometric specification incorporating pre- and post-controls for selection bias as well as spatial autocorrelation was employed to test for statistical relationships between the development of dispersed public housing sites and sub- sequent increases in various types of crime. The findings suggest that proximity to dispersed public housing was not associated with any post-development increase in reported crime of any type.

AB  - This paper examines the consequences of a system of neighbourhood environmental service provision which fails to pay sufficient attention to territorial differences in need for such services. It explores the impacts of a territorial injustice of service provision for poor neighbourhoods, arguing that insufficient service provision operates as a neighbourhood effect compounding the problems of being poor and living in a poor area. The paper shows how high levels of social need and a failure within environmental service provision to compensate for these levels of need combine and interact to deepen the environmental problems encountered in many deprived neighbourhoods. In particular, the paper shows how these interactions reduce the capacity of both front line service providers and neighbourhood residents to cope with environmental challenges and thus reveals processes which entrench neighbourhood disadvantage. In so doing, the paper contributes to debates about how so-called neighbourhood effects occur.

AB  - This paper reviews studies which have dealt with the relationship between morningness-eveningness (circadian typology) and other individual differences such as age, sex, personality dimensions and work schedule of their subjects. It appeared that the changes in the morningness-eveningness preference covaried with the age related changes in the internal body clock. An older age was associated with morningness while younger subjects tended towards eveningness, the critical age for the circadian typology change was 50 years. Sex-related differences are too small to be reflected in the scores on circadian typology questionnaires, although women were ahead of men by 1 hr in their circadian rhythms. The results on work schedule proved its role as a synchronizer modifying the morningness factor. The morningness dimension and extraversion are probably related through the impulsivity subdimension, which is closely associated with brain activation. Further research is needed to clarify the relationship between morningness and other personality dimensions (neuroticism, psychoticism), because the results are inconclusive. The influence of circadian typology on the tolerance to shift work and life habits are also discussed. The results with regard to shift work revealed the importance of morningness in determining human tolerance and health complaints. As regards life habits, there were differences in various aspects related to carcadian typology especially psychoactive substances consumption.

METHODS: Two different data sources were used: 1) neighbourhood- level objective socioeconomic indicators, and 2) individual-level questionnaires from a community survey (response rate: 48%) to assess quality of life, neighbourhood perceptions, housing variables, and lifestyle. Multilevel analyses were conducted using both neighbourhood-level and individual-level data. RESULTS: Neighbourhood-level socioeconomic deprivation was associated with two aspects of individual-level quality of life: mental health and perceived health. Individual-level neighbourhood perceptions regarding social cohesion mediated these associations. Lifestyle also had mediating effects. CONCLUSION: Neighbourhood socioeconomic deprivation variables may impact on the individual through cognitive mechanisms that are associated with appraisal of the wider social environment.

AB  - Although we know a lot about why households choose certain dwellings, we know relatively little about the mechanisms behind their choice of neighbourhood. Most studies of neighbourhood choice focus only on one or two dimensions of neighbourhoods: typically poverty and ethnicity. In this paper we argue that neighbourhoods have multiple dimensions and that models of neighbourhood choice should take these dimensions into account. We propose the use of a conditional logit model. From this approach we can gain insight into the interaction between individual and neighbourhood characteristics which lead to the choice of a particular neighbourhood over alternative destinations. We use Swedish register data to model neighbourhood choice for all households which moved in the city of Uppsala between 1997 and 2006. Our results show that neighbourhood sorting is a highly structured process where households are very likely to choose neighbourhoods where the neighbourhood population matches their own characteristics. We find that income is the most important driver of the sorting process, although ethnicity and other demographic and socioeconomic characteristics play important roles as well.

AB  - Little attention has been paid to date to the role of the neighbourhood as a factor influencing residential mobility and the residential choice process. The question addressed here is to what extent neighbourhood characteristics (percentage of rented dwellings, low-income households, and ethnic minorities in the neighbourhood) influence different categories of residents to wish to leave their neighbourhood. The answer to this question can enhance our understanding of residential mobility and of the mechanisms causing segregation by income and ethnic groups. We use data from the 2002 Netherlands Housing Demand Survey, enriched with neighbourhood characteristics. Whether or not people wish to leave their neighbourhood is estimated using a multilevel logistic regression model with cross-level interaction effects between individual and neighbourhood characteristics. The main result shows that, with an increasing percentage of people from an ethnic minority in the neighbourhood, more people have the wish to leave the neighbourhood. However, this is to a lesser extent the case for members of ethnic minorities themselves.

AB  - Explores the consequences of attempting to ignore one aspect of performance while analyzing the other. In particular, it is argued that the twin problems of what to do with error-response latencies and how to equate Ss on speed-accuracy trade-off have seriously clouded efforts to understand individual differences in cognitive processing. It is shown how both of these problems can be solved by collecting data in a way that allows the determination of how accuracy and latency covary within each cell of the design. Results from 4 studies using diverse cognitive tasks (mental rotation, letter matching, synonyms, and numerical analogies) also suggest that this method yields scores that better capture the information-processing characteristics of individuals than do conventional analyses based on errors or latencies.

AB  - Urban form, the law, and health are undoubtedly linked. However, nonlegal factors such as 20th-century reliance on the automobile as well as associated governmental actions and private investment choices have greatly influenced urban form, especially urban sprawl. The American system of federalism, with its traditional allocation of land-use legal authority to local governments, and resulting fragmented legal authority over causes and effects of urban sprawl, renders difficult legal efforts to reshape urban form. Legal frameworks and the dynamics and effects of urban sprawl are largely mismatched. Still, existing legal frameworks and modest legal reforms provide means to encourage or at least allow urban forms that are more conducive to health. However, the law will not easily transform urban form and deter urban sprawl.

AB  - This study examined the effects of personality (psychoticism) and nominal vs real groups using brainstorming techniques in problem solving. Subjects either brainstormed three problems on their own, in pairs or in four person groups consisting of similar personality scores. There were six dependent measures: total number of non-redundant ideas; number of ‘superior’ responses; a rating on the quality of the ideas; the percentage of superior responses; a creativity production rate and a self-rating of imaginativeness. It was predicted that high P scorers brainstorming alone would have the highest creative scores but when they interact with similar types of individuals in group settings, their superior score rate would be overtaken by equivalent groups of low creative individuals. This prediction was supported for four person groups on the number and percentage of superior response measures and the mean creative rate measure. Dyads total creativity scores were always lower than four person nominal or real groups or two individuals working alone. There were almost no significant interactions between personality type, group size or the tasks used. Implications for organizations is discussed and the direction of future research is examined.

The primary objectives were: (1) to evaluate the influence of student characteristics and public high school social climate on adolescent global self-esteem in a first-stage or micro-model; (2) to evaluate the influence of social climate on the variability of individual differences from school to school in a second-stage or macro-model; and (3) to cross-validate the first- and second-stage models to assess generalizability of the findings. Schools (n = 219) and students (n = 13022) were sampled from High School and Beyond, a database representative of secondary schools and students in the U.S.A.; half the sample was set aside for cross-validation purposes. Collective well-being and distress were predictors of adolescent esteem in the presence of theoretically important student characteristics. The relationship of social climate to variability of esteem suggests that a positive climate may reduce individual differences within the school. Methodological comments on the employed multilevel analysis are offered.

AB  - High numerate individuals tend to be more successful probabilistic problem solvers than those lower in numeracy. These individual differences, however, can be modulated through the presentation format of external information, although discrepancies have been reported. The present investigation addressed these discrepancies by using formally equivalent Bayesian reasoning problems differing in numerical format and problem complexity. As previously observed, with a complex problem all participants were at floor level with probabilistic information, while individual differences emerged with natural frequency data. In sharp contrast, with a simple problem, differences between numeracy levels were diminished with natural frequencies, with group differences emerging only with probabilistic formats. Accordingly, the impact of numeracy in Bayesian reasoning depends both on numerical format and verbal complexity, and further suggests that lower numerate individuals are not inherently unable to reason in a Bayesian-like manner. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The relationship of individual differences, perceptions of lying in everyday life (EL) and perceptions of lying in a high stakes scenario (HSS) was investigated. It was expected that the personality constructs of Acting, Manipulativeness, Impression Management and Sociability would be positively related to a perceived ability to lie in EL and in a HSS, and that the construct of Anxiousness would be negatively related to the perceived ability to lie in EL and in a HSS. 265 undergraduate students were administered 5 personality construct measures, and a series of questions and statements concerning perceptions of lying in EL and in a HSS. In EL, there were significant findings for Acting and Manipulativeness in relation to perceptions of experiencing little guilt and mental effort whilst lying, experiencing duping delight, finding lying easy and that the lies are undetectable. In the HSS there were significant findings for Manipulativeness in relation to the perceptions of feeling comfortable (before, during and after) the lie, being believed by the target of the lie and perceiving the situation better dealt with a lie rather than the truth, and Anxiousness in relation to planning the lie and being uncomfortable while lying.

AB  - Background Many individuals are subject to the physically and mentally detrimental effects of living in substandard housing and inadequate neighbourhoods. We propose that better physical neighbourhood quality can partially offset some of the negative effects of poor housing quality on psychological well-being.\nMethods Interviews and questionnaires were used to collect data in a cross-sectional study of housing quality, the state of the surrounding environment, and individual health and well-being for 5605 European adults from the Large Analysis and Review of European housing and health Status conducted by WHO in eight European cities. Multilevel random coefficient modelling was used to statistically analyse the main and interactive effects of housing quality and neighbourhood quality on psychological well-being. Socioeconomic status, employment status, gender and marital status were included as statistical controls.\nResults and conclusions Substandard housing quality and poor neighbourhood quality each contribute to lower psychological well-being. Furthermore better neighbourhood quality buffers against the negative effects of poor housing quality on psychological well-being. These results fill a gap in research concerning the ability of neighbourhood quality to amplify or attenuate housing quality impacts on well-being.

AB  - In the second half of the 1990s, socio-spatial segregation increased in Brazilian cities, accentuating inequity among social groups. Using a combination of space syntax techniques and statistical analysis, this paper explores locational differences in central and peripheral portions of Belém. The analysis shows how socio-spatial segregation was made more pronounced by relationships between urban form, infrastructure provision and locational values. Social groups' opportunities in the city are suggested to be limited by features of its urban form, associated with infrastructure provision, especially for groups unable to take advantage of intra-urban accessibility. The paper also discusses the findings of the study in relation to the Brazilian urban context at the end of the 1990s.

AB  - There are strongly-held arguments regarding attitudes to the death penalty on both sides of the debate. The current study examines how underlying individual differences in personality, expressed morality, prior victimhood, attitudes to abortion, and gender predict attitudes to the death penalty. An online questionnaire design was used, comprising a measure of personality (the IPIP-50), a measure of socio-moral attitudes, a measure assessing attitudes to abortion, and as an outcome, the death penalty attitude scale. High Extraversion and Conscientiousness, low Openness and Emotional Stability, and lower pro-abortion attitudes all significantly predicted support for the use of the death penalty. In a multivariate analysis all constructs bar Emotional Stability remained independent predictors of support for the death penalty. Males were more in support of the death penalty and more retributive and revenge-orientated in their rationale for such support. These findings reinforce previous research surrounding individual influences on attitudes to the death penalty and indicate personality factors shaping right-wing authoritarianism as key influences on the construct, rather than a priori higher level measures of morality, gender or victimhood. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

High-resolution thermal imagery collected by the National Aeronautical and space Administration (NASA) is used in conjunction with parcel-level tax records to examine the interaction between the design of single-family residential parcels and the emission of radiant heat energy. Results from a path analysis illustrate that lower density patterns of residential developmetn contribute more radiant heat energy to surface heat island formation than higher density development patterns within the Atlanta region. Comparct moderate-to-high-density new construction and area-based tree ordinances are recommended as policy strategies for mitigating the effects of urban development on regional climate change.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We conducted spatial analyses to determine the geographic variation of cancer at the neighbourhood level (dissemination areas or DAs) within the area of a single Ontario public health unit, Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph, covering a population of 238,326 inhabitants. Cancer incidence data between 1999 and 2003 were obtained from the Ontario Cancer Registry and were geocoded down to the level of DA using the enhanced Postal Code Conversion File. The 2001 Census of Canada provided information on the size and age-sex structure of the population at the DA level, in addition to information about selected census covariates, such as average neighbourhood income. RESULTS: Age standardized incidence ratios for cancer and the prevalence of census covariates were calculated for each of 331 dissemination areas in Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph. The standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for cancer varied dramatically across the dissemination areas. However, application of the Moran's I statistic, a popular index of spatial autocorrelation, suggested significant spatial patterns for only two cancers, lung and prostate, both in males (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). Employing Bayesian hierarchical models, areas in the urban core of the City of Guelph had significantly higher SIRs for male lung cancer than the remainder of Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph; and, neighbourhoods in the urban and surrounding rural areas of Orangeville exhibited significantly higher SIRs for prostate cancer. After adjustment for age and spatial dependence, average household income attenuated much of the spatial pattern of lung cancer, but not of prostate cancer. CONCLUSION: This paper demonstrates the feasibility and utility of a systematic approach to identifying neighbourhoods, within the area served by a public health unit, that have significantly higher risks of cancer. This exploratory, ecologic study suggests several hypotheses for these spatial patterns that warrant further investigations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Canadian study published in the peer-reviewed literature estimating the risk of relatively rare public health outcomes at a very small areal level, namely dissemination areas.

AB  - This paper explores how mobile phones are being used by informal construction workers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. It reveals that ownership of mobile phones is stratified along employment lines. This observation acts as a good indicator of what is now perhaps the biggest split in employment in many developing economies: a split between a stratum of employers and middlemen (who in Dar es Salaams informal construction sector are also mostly using mobile phones), and a stratum of employees, apprentices, family labourers and marginal-owner operators (who are generally not using mobile phones). The applicability of government policy on information and communication technology (ICT) is assessed in the context of these findings. This leads to the suggestion that since Tanzanias small-enterprise development policy concentrates on use of the internet, much of this is irrelevant to the majority of informal-sector construction enterprises which when they do use ICT rely almost exclusively on mobile phones as a significant cost-saving device.

AB  - This paper develops a set of quantitative variables to characterise urban forms at the metropolitan level and, in particular, to distinguish compactness from 'sprawl'. It first reviews and analyses past research on the definitions of urban form, compactness and sprawl, and corresponding quantitative variables. Four quantitative variables are developed to measure four dimensions of urban form at the metropolitan level: metropolitan size, activity intensity, the degree that activities are evenly distributed, and the extent that high-density sub-areas are clustered. Through a series of simulation analyses, the global Moran coefficient, which characterises the fourth dimension, distinguishes compactness from sprawl. It is high, intermediate and close to zero for monocentric, polycentric and decentralised sprawling forms respectively. In addition, the more there is more local sprawl, composed of discontinuity and strip development, the lower is the Moran coefficient.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purposes of this study are to determine (i) if neighbourhood socioeconomic status (SES) is systematically related to the prevalence of overweight children and youth in Canada, (ii) if the factors accounting for the apparent relationship have face validity, and (iii) if neighbourhood SES has an independent influence on this distribution. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from Cycle 4 (2000/2001) of the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth were used. Children and youth aged 5 to 17 were included. Overweight was established using age and sex cut-off points. Neighbourhood socioeconomic data were obtained from the Statistics Canada 2001 Dissemination Area databases and SES quartiles constructed using a composite of socio-economic variables. Hierarchical non-linear modelling was used to test for independent neighbourhood effects. RESULTS: A gradient of increasing overweight prevalence by decreasing neighbourhood SES quartiles was observed (24% high SES, 30% mid-high SES, 33% mid-low SES, 35% low SES). Controlling for individual age, gender, family income and education hierarchical analysis found that a child's odds of being overweight increases if living in a low versus a high SES neighbourhood (OR=1.29, 95% CI=1.14-1.46). INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of child and youth overweight in Canada is inversely and statistically significantly related to neighbourhood SES. Independent effects indicate that neighbourhood characteristics directly influence the odds of being overweight. This research suggests that consideration of opportunity structures that exist in different types of neighbourhoods is fundamentally important to health promotion and disease prevention strategies.

AB  - While prior research has identified several individual characteristics and contextual factors influential on an employee's quantity of self-development participation, no research has examined multiplicative effects among these factors. This study investigated person-situation interactions among five individual characteristics (e.g., openness to experience) and the contextual factor of workplace support for self-development. This study also sought to investigate the link between proactive personality and self-development participation, a promising individual characteristic that has received little attention in the self-development literature. Data collected from 136 employees demonstrates significant interactions between workplace support with learning goal orientation, openness to experience, and conscientiousness. As hypothesized, workplace support is more strongly, positively linked to quantity of self-development participation for employees lower in these traits. In contrast, the provision of external support is rather inconsequential for those high in these traits, as these employees demonstrate an internal propensity to engage in voluntary development regardless of the support available. Regarding proactive personality, a significant positive relationship was observed with self-development quantity. Further, although the expected interaction between proactive personality and workplace support did not reach statistical significance (p= .056), it was in the hypothesized direction. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In the current study (N=193), we demonstrated that participants' primary worries were focused within domains central to reproductive success and mate-value. Furthermore, mating strategy predicted worries in the domains of social status and mating. Neuroticism, as an individual difference reflecting vigilance to threats, was correlated with worry about fitness-relevant but not fitness-irrelevant domains. The current study documents the first domain-specific assessment of worries and complements this analysis with intriguing individual difference predictors of worry. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines contributions to the study of urban form in Canada by French and English researchers working in a variety of disciplines, especially architecture, planning, geography, and history. Instead of discussing contributions purely along traditional linguistic or disciplinary lines, the authors use a novel classification scheme to identify and categorize significant works according to their particular epistemological perspective, before describing noteworthy contributions of various academic disciplines by key authors and research themes. The most significant contributions to the study of urban form in Canada have come from two largely isolated camps: first, architects/planners, mostly from Quebec, who examine form as a relatively independent system and work in the tradition of the so-called Italian school of process typology; and secondly, predominantly anglophone urban and historical geographers who deal with built forms and urban morphogenesis as a product of external forces. Recent work suggests that the two solitudes may be coming together.

In two experiments, participants listened to a spatial text (Experiments 1 and 2) and a non-spatial text (Experiment 1), at the same time performing a spatial or a verbal concurrent task, or no secondary task. To understand how individuals who differ in spatial ability process spatial text during dual task performance, spatial individual differences were analyzed. The tasks administered were the Vandenberg and Kuse [Vandenberg, S. G., & Kuse, A. R. (1978). Mental rotation, a group test of three-dimensional spatial visualization. Perceptual and Motor Skills, 47, 599-604.] mental rotation test (MRT) and a reading comprehension task (RCT). Individuals with high (HMR) and low (LMR) mental rotation differed in MRT scores but had similar RCT performance. Results showed that the HMR group, in contrast with LMR counterparts, preserved good spatial text recall even when a spatial concurrent task was performed; however, Experiment 2 revealed a modification of spatial concurrent task performance in LMR as well in HMR group. Overall, results suggest that HMR individuals have more spatial resources than LMR individuals, allowing them to compensate for spatial working memory interference, but only to a limited extent, given that the processing of spatial information is still mediated by VSWM. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

It will argue that analysing the four-year old ENP presents a wide variety of challenges for scholars of the EU's relations with its near neighbours, in particular the question of theoretical presuppositions. The chapter will discuss these challenges in four parts involving the methodological location of ENP; the theoretical framing of ENP; a ‘normative power' approach to ENP; and concluding with a brief analytical reflection. The chapter also carries an argument - that the challenges of studying the ENP are least well served by traditional approaches to political science, and might be better advanced by rethinking these presumptions. Thus, conventional presumptions of ‘much ado about nothing' in ENP may benefit from a reflection on the extent to which these presumptions are determinate in analysing whether ENP is ‘as you like it'

AB  - This paper presents a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) super-structure model for the optimal design of distributed energy generation systems that satisfy the heating and power demand at the level of a small neighborhood. The objective is the optimal selection of the system components among several candidate technologies (micro combined heat and power units, photovoltaic arrays, boilers, central power grid), including the optimal design of a heating pipeline network, that allows heat exchange among the different nodes. The objective function to be minimised contains the annualised overall investment cost and the annual operating cost of the system. We show that besides the usual energy balance and unit operations constraints, additional equations must be included in the model to guarantee correctness of the produced heating pipeline designs. A special instance of the problem where a single centralised combined heat and power unit is installed in the neighborhood is also considered. The efficiency of the proposed model is evaluated through illustrating examples. âº A new model is presented for the optimal configuration of DER systems. âº The model includes the design of the heating pipeline network. âº The model is applied to a neighbourhood of 10 buildings located in central Greece. âº A centralised CHP case and a 20-buildings scenario illustrate the model’s flexibility and scalability. âº The microgrid is superior to the conventional case in terms of cost.

AB  - Grimm and Railsback start with a general primer on modeling: how to design models that are as simple as possible while still allowing specific problems to be solved, and how to move efficiently through a cycle of pattern-oriented model design, implementation, and analysis. Next, they address the problems of theory and conceptual framework for individual-based ecology: What is "theory"? That is, how do we develop reusable models of how system dynamics arise from characteristics of individuals? What conceptual framework do we use when the classical differential equation framework no longer applies? An extensive review illustrates the ecological problems that have been addressed with individual-based models. The authors then identify how the mechanics of building and using individual-based models differ from those of traditional science, and provide guidance on formulating, programming, and analyzing models. This book will be helpful to ecologists interested in modeling, and to other scientists interested in agent-based modeling.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to explore students' selection of information strategies in a task-oriented reading situation. 72 secondary school students read two texts and answered six questions per text, three of which were manipulated to induce a misleading matching between the wording of the question and distracting pieces of information in the text. The reading and question-answering were presented with the software Read&Answer. We analyzed how skilled and less-skilled comprehenders were attracted to the distracting pieces of information and how this affected reading patterns and task outcomes. Skilled comprehenders scored higher and were able to discard the distracting information. In contrast, less-skilled comprehenders copied and processed this information in more detail. On-line data provided evidence for these behaviors. These results suggest that skilled comprehension facilitates the use of idea-based selection of information strategies, whereas less-skilled comprehension induces the inappropriate use of word-matching selection of information strategies. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - As society faces concerns over rising obesity rates, traffic congestion and global warming, attention is turning to the importance of creating more walkable environments. The objective of this study was to investigate how community stakeholders, at both neighbourhood and municipal levels, describe the socio-political process of creating walkable neighbourhoods. Thirty-one key informants were interviewed about walking issues identified by older people in four different neighbourhoods in Ottawa, Canada. Five dimensions of the process were identified through qualitative analysis that elucidated insights on political context, access channels, resources, actors and opportunities. Creating walkable neighbourhoods is ultimately a political process that involves the convergence of resources facilitated by actors who are able to bridge sectors, organizations and levels of the system. Mobilization of resources at the neighbourhood level affected citizens’ abilities to utilize access channels and act on opportunity raising considerations around equity. Future efforts to improve walkability will require that conventional bureaucracies develop approaches that are sensitive to place-based needs.

To probe this question, a large sample of young adults (males, n = 898; females, n = 733) completed both the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Eysenck, Eysenck & Barrett, Personality and Individual Differences, 6, 21-29, 1985) and the Listening Styles Profile (Watson, Barker & Weaver, International Journal of Listening, 9, 1-13, 1995). Consistent with expectations, the findings revealed that distinctly different patterns of listening styles were associated with each of three personality dimensions. The psychoticism personality type was linked with a socially callous listening style. The extraversion personality type was associated with a friendly and supportive 'people' oriented listening style. The neuroticism personality type, on the other hand, was correlated with listening styles that minimized the time spent interacting with others.

AB  - Neighbourhood governance refers to the range of activities and institutions that influence the social and material conditions of a neighbourhood. While neighbourhood-level democracy has long been a key concern, the centralisation of power at the city and state levels has reduced the neighbourhood's political significance, and the shape of neighbourhood governance has become increasingly more complicated. In recent decades, the reduced levels of government intervention, the privatisation of many local services and activities, and the increasing social diversity and inequality have led to a fragmentation of roles and responsibilities in local areas. Under these conditions, the need for a more active engagement by local residents in neighbourhood affairs has become more strongly felt. While the better-educated, economically comfortable, and long-term residents may be involved in civil society networks and active neighbourhood associations, other neighbourhoods may be either subject to privatisation of local governance, or a lack of capacity or knowledge to negotiate local differences and deal with everyday challenges.

AB  - Various aspects of socioeconomic conditions in the neighbourhood have in recent years been found to have an influence on morbidity and mortality even after individual characteristics are taken into account.1 Increasing evidence suggests that to measure fully the impact social conditions may have on mortality risk, the whole life course must be taken into account as mortality risk increases cumulatively over the life course.2 Few studies have combined ecological and life course factors to see if contextual effects may be explained by social conditions earlier in life at the individual level.3,4 Most studies of neighbourhood effects have had a cross sectional design or with short follow up. Effects seen could be a consequence of the fact that people in these areas may have different earlier life experiences that have not been fully taken into account. In this study we examine whether the contextual effect of educational level aggregated to the neighbourhood on mortality risk could be explained by earlier life deprivation.

Using both intra-individual and inter-individual analyses, we found that: (1) stressors reported by subjects were diverse, although there were mainly minor daily hassles in nature; (2) the use of both direct coping and suppression was only moderately consistent; (3) reported negative emotions were very stable, and not amenable to coping, positive emotions were less stable, and happiness was affected by coping, after individual differences were controlled. Implications for the person-situation interaction, and the relationship between coping and emotional outcomes are discussed. Copyright ?? 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate individual differences in subjective sensitivity to noise associated with different dimensions of anger in adolescents of different ages and of both sexes. Participants (N = 234) completed the Sensitivity to Noise test (Santisteban, 1990, 1992) and the State-Trait Anger expression Inventory (Spielberger, 1988). Results showed a significant correlation between sensitivity to noise and different anger aspects feelings (in anger state), temperament (in trait anger), and internal expression (in anger expression) as well as differences related to demographic characteristics. It was concluded that noise may act as a stressor causing unwanted aversive changes in an affective state, such as anger; that these changes are related to several psychobiological characteristics of the subject, such as age, sex, and individual sensitivity to noise. © 2004 Individual Differences Research Group.

AB  - The premise of this paper is that cities, such as Lincoln, Nebraska, which possesses a modern architectural heritage (mainly American Victorian and early twentieth century), and are in a constant process of development, can offer unexplored urban form configurations typical for current urban circumstances. The study method is divided into two stages. The first stage of the analysis includes the identification of four predetermined categories of urban form elements. The urban form element as such is viewed as an integration of urban physical attributes (geometric shape, size, materials) and content (uses, activities). The second stage of the analysis attempts to identify ways by which urban form elements are arranged and create urban form configuration types. Six categories of arrangements have been identified. The criteria, used to analyse the attributes of the urban elements and their arrangements into typical form configurations, derive from ecological and anthropological sources.

AB  - This study tests a path model in which residential satisfaction, operationalized in terms of multidimensional perceived residential environment quality (PREQ), predicts neighbourhood attachment considered as the final criterion. Socio-demographic (age, sex, socio-economic level) and residential (length of residence both in the neighbourhood and in Rome, number of persons living together) variables are also included in the theoretical model as predictors of both PREQ and neighbourhood attachment. Using a multidimensional questionnaire for the measurement of PREQ and a unidimensional scale for the measurement of neighbourhood attachment, the study focuses on a sample of 497 inhabitants from 20 different neighbourhoods in the city of Rome. The multidimensional PREQ questionnaire comprises 20 different scales covering four main areas: architectural and town-planning features (six scales); social relations features (three scales); punctual and in-network services (six scales); context features (five scales). First, the path model is tested separately in each area using structural equation analysis. Then, the best predictors emerging from each area, together with all socio-demographic and residential variables, are included in a final model. This model shows both the relevance of predictors from all four areas in predicting attachment, and also a hierarchy between the areas in the power of the prediction (context area giving the most powerful predictors, services giving the weakest ones, architectural and town-planning, and social relations having intermediate importance). Length of residence in the neighbourhood and socio-economic level are the most relevant of the residential and socio-demographic variables. Results are discussed with reference to the multicomponential nature of the process of neighbourhood attachment.

AB  - Interest in inspection time (IT), uniformly thought to index 'speed-of-processing', has been maintained because of its established empirical correlation with general mental ability and performance IQ measures. The IT procedure generally consists of a simple visual discrimination task displayed at various critical exposure durations and immediately followed by a suitable mask. Processing is assumed to terminate at mask onset, which seems inappropriate in light of the target/mask composite necessarily available with integration theories of backward masking. The present paper reports five experiments involving attended and unattended secondary stimuli and additional factor analyses of previous studies involving IT. From these it is proposed that IT is better thought of as indexing the power an individual can bring to bear within a specific cognitive domain rather than 'speed-of-processing' per se. The consequence is that the observed IT-IQ correlation is merely the inevitable outcome of measuring the same domain with two different tasks; rather than due to some elemental factor such as mental speed underlying both tasks. Ways in which this model could be tested are discussed. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This study adds to the literature by (i) investigating the relationship between neighbourhood quality and child health, (ii) by utilizing subjective assessments by individuals familiar with the neighbourhood (i.e., the survey respondent and interviewer), and (iii) by utilizing multiple assessments of neighbourhood quality, and (iv) by investigating several measures of health. Other work has found that controlling for family level characteristics reduces or eliminates the apparent association between neighbourhood quality and health. We find, measuring both child well-being and neighbourhood quality multi-dimensionally, that even after controlling for family level characteristics neighbourhood quality has strong associations with child well-being.

AB  - Although several studies have demonstrated that differential parenting has a negative impact on the children exposed to it, only a small number of studies have attempted to understand why  differential parenting occurs within families. The goal of the present study was to examine the contextual correlates of differential parenting. Specifically, the association between parental socioeconomic status (SES) and differential parenting and the association between objective and subjective indices of neighbourhood quality and differential parenting were investigated.                 Data were collected as part of the Kids, Families, and Places (KFP) study and analyzed using multilevel modeling. Six hundred and fifty families provided data on 881 children. Five hundred and ninety nine families included a father in the home. Close to seventy five percent of children included in the sample were less than six years of age. Differential parenting was assessed separately for mothers and fathers and across positive and negative parenting outcomes. The findings revealed that parental SES was significantly associated with differential parenting for three of four parenting outcomes. For mothers, SES was negatively associated with differential positivity and negativity. For fathers, SES was negatively associated with differential positivity but not negativity. The objective quality of neighbourhoods in which families resided (i.e., measured as a composite score that combined census tract data on neighbourhood disadvantage and interviewer observations of neighbourhood physical and social disorder) was positively associated with maternal differential negativity; however, this association was also moderated by mothers' subjective perceptions of their neighbourhoods (i.e., measured using maternal reports of neighbourhood collective efficacy). In other words, when mothers perceived their neighbourhoods to be highly cohesive and supportive, exposure to objectively unfavourable neighbourhood conditions was less strongly associated with differential negativity. Objective neighbourhood quality was not associated with the other three differential parenting outcomes of interest.                 These findings highlight the important relationship that exists between contextual influences both within and outside of the immediate family and differential parenting. Moreover, they speak to the importance of including both mothers and fathers in studies of differential parenting. The merits of using multilevel modelling to investigate differential parenting and suggestions for future research are discussed.

Why traditional towns have such a form that appears to us as an organism? Are those structures «irregular» or «regular»? Regarding those settlements that have been growing organically, and by providing empirical evidence, from the case studies, on the links between the urban form and its topographical conditions, one can set a geometry for Portuguese traditional cities, its origins and formation. Location types and internal structure are repeated so often that broad and suggestive generalisations are valid.

A non-nested multilevel logit analysis is performed on a parcel-level dataset of all single-family residential parcels located within 128 inner-ring suburbs of Chicago, between 2000 and 2010. Findings indicate that properties with smaller houses, lower floor-area to lot-size ratios, and lower ratios of their value to that of their neighbourhood, as well as properties located in high-quality school districts, are more likely to be redeveloped. The median property value of a neighbourhood does not have a large effect on whether a property is redeveloped, but neighbourhoods with higher proportions of Black and Hispanic residents were significantly less likely to experience redevelopment.

In this sense, it is a descendant of the popular participation and active citizenship experiments that have marked Brazilian political culture in recent years. The article discusses the limits and ambiguity of the public authorities, anchored in a distributive growth coalition in the form of the "onerous license".

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation between neighbourhood socioeconomic and ethnic characteristics with depressive symptoms in a population based sample. DESIGN: Cross sectional data from the CARDIA study, including the Center for Epidemiological Studies depression scale score (CES-D). Neighbourhoods were 1990 US census blocks of 1000 people; six census variables reflecting wealth/income, education, and occupation investigated separately and as a summary score; neighbourhood racial composition (percentage white and black) and individual level income and education were also examined. SETTING: Participants recruited in 1985/86 from community lists in Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis MN; from a health plan in Oakland, CA. PARTICIPANTS: 3437 adults aged 28-40 years in 1995/96: 24% white men, 27% white women, 20% black men, 29% black women. MAIN RESULTS: For each race-sex group, CES-D was inversely related to neighbourhood score and individual income and education. Associations of neighbourhood score with CES-D became weak and inconsistent after adjusting for individual level factors; personal income remained strongly and inversely associated with CES-D. Age adjusted mean differences (standard errors) in CES-D between the lowest and highest income categories were 3.41 (0.62) for white men, 4.57 (0.64) for white women, 5.80 (0.87) for black men, and 5.74 (0.83) for black women. For both black and white participants, CES-D was associated negatively with percentage of white people and positively with percentage of black people in their census block, before, but not after, adjustment for individual and neighbourhood socioeconomic variables. CONCLUSIONS: Neither neighbourhood socioeconomic characteristics nor ethnic density were consistently related to depressive symptoms once individual socioeconomic characteristics were taken into account

AB  - Arguments about sustainable urban form have generally been in normative terms without recourse to its practicality. The paper shows that the essential elements of urban form are outcomes of real estate markets. The focus of the research is to examine the economic sustainability constraints to the adaptation of the existing urban form via housing market development viability. To address the task a number of econometric models are linked together to estimate spatial patterns of viability in five cities. The results demonstrate a substantial difference between cities that can be attributed not to urban form per se but to socioeconomic factors. This demonstrates that in practice it is impossible to divorce the physical structure of cities from their economic and social structure. Viability is also influenced strongly by public policy through the location of social housing. The research suggests that a driving force/constraint for development viability is the level of neighbourhood house prices. Large swathes of negative viability are found even without accounting for the additional costs of brownfield development, suggesting that there are major constraints to the reconfiguration of housing markets in some cities in a piecemeal way. © 2009 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.

Re-suits from a path analysis illustrate that lower density patterns of residential development contribute more radiant heat energy to surface heat island formation than higher density development patterns within the Atlanta region.

Interest spans notions of the design, constituent elements and development of the ideal urban (or suburban) community, and the role of the neighbourhood unit as a means of both physical and social organisation, through to its more recent articulation as a framework for improving local democracy and participation in a collaborative planning process. In the context of the latter, a number of case study cities, where neighbourhood planning approaches have been used to identify, negotiate, and reconcile wider strategic interests with community interests and concerns, are presented. ?? 2012 Copyright ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved..

AB  - Utilising the idea of transitional processes towards environment friendly cities and communities, this paper outlines some strategies to manage climate change in the urban environment and envisages new steps towards a carbon neutral, socially inclusive post-carbon city. It is argued that, in order to approach low carbon issues in the built environment of the city, it is necessary to turn the perceptive and physical approach to urban form “inside-out”, according to a reversed approach focussed on the “void” of the city. The paper, stressing the important role that a new urban model might play in a transition pathway to a lower carbon electricity economy, also contends that it is necessary to investigate the human and social life within the city by looking for possible intersections between urban renewal needs and basic human needs like food, energy, culture and communication. It begins with a brief review of current urban building design and perspectives, situating these in the context of the body of research on energy efficient and low carbon issues in a socio-technical oriented city model.

AB  - Anchoring is a well-known effect leading to bias in estimation in various decision-making contexts. Previous research examining the role of individual differences in anchoring susceptibility has found weak and unreliable results. In this study anchoring was examined in a simulated poker-like card game, among people with varying levels of academic achievement and using a wide variety of psychometric tests for both cognitive ability and decision style/personality factors. Overall, anchoring susceptibility was largely unrelated to demographic and cognitive measures but weakly correlated to measures of preference and aptitude for rationality. Performance generally improved during the course of the card game task, suggesting that participants became less susceptible to anchoring with experience and these improvements were weakly-to-moderately related to demographic, cognitive and decision style measures. That is, while there were few significant predictors of overall performance, cognitive ability measures and decision styles were related to decreases in anchoring susceptibility. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Examined differences in how 12 high- and 12 low-creative Ss used conscious and nonconscious (automatic) clues to solve anagrams. During the establishment of the presence/absence word-detection thresholds, low-creative Ss gave almost no false alarms, while all high-creative Ss produced false alarms. Results indicate that high-creative Ss had significantly faster threshold times and used more nonconscious clues and unconsciously primed solutions. Individual differences related to creativity may influence the processing of unconsciously presented information. (PsycINFO Database Copyright 1990 American Psychological Assn, all rights reserved)

AB  - Research on the historical geography of settlements in Poland has its beginnings in studies by economic historians at the end of the nineteenth century. During the inter-war period research on the geography of cities and on their historical geography in particular was developing slowly. Among works devoted to settlement geography, as many as nine out of ten were concerned with rural settlements. After the Second World War urban studies advanced considerably. Today the morphology of cities is a subject of interest to a relatively small group of researchers in Poland, Wroclaw and ód being the only significant research centres. Morphogenetic studies of urban centres predominate. Metrological-historical studies have lost favour.

AB  - This study used longitudinal data from the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) to examine the role of neighbourhood quality, assessed when cohort members were aged five, in boys' and girls' school leaving age. It was expected that, since context is in general more strongly predictive of boys' rather than girls' behaviour, neighbourhood quality would be more strongly related to men's than women's school leaving age. Results showed that, as expected, even after controlling for cognitive ability, parental socio-economic disadvantage and social class, family structure, and maternal education, age and depressed mood, neighbourhood quality was more strongly related to men's than women's school leaving age. To rule out the possibility that neighbourhood quality is simply picking up individual level social class the study also explored the interaction of neighbourhood quality with parental social class. It was found that, compared to cohort members of high social class groups, cohort members of lower social class groups were less likely to stay in education after the minimum school leaving age in both neighbourhood groups, but being in the lower social class groups was more of a disadvantage for children living in well-to-do rather than average or poor neighbourhoods at age five.

AB  - For the first time in human history, more than half the world s population is urban. A fundamental aspect of this transformation has been the emergence of giant cities, or megacities, that present major new challenges. This book examines how issues of megacity development, urban form, sustainability, and unsustainability are conceived, how governance processes are influenced by these ideas, and how these processes have in turn influenced outcomes on the ground, in some cases in transformative ways. Through 15 in-depth case studies by prominent researchers from around the world, this book examines the major challenges facing megacities today. The studies are organized around a shared set of concerns and questions about issues of sustainability, land development, urban governance, and urban form. Some of the main questions addressed are: What are the most pressing issues of sustainability and urban form in each megacity? How are major issues of sustainability understood and framed by policymakers? Is urban form considered a significant component of sustainability issues in public debates and public policy? Who are the key actors framing urban sustainability challenges and shaping urban change? How is unsustainability, risk, or disaster imagined, and how are those concerns reflected in policy approaches? What has been achieved so far, and what challenges remain? The publication of this book is a step toward answering these and other crucial questions.

AB  - Previous research on intercity differences in crime rates neglects individual determinants of youth delinquency, whereas studies focusing on neighbourhoodand individual-level explanations of youth delinquency neglect higher-level, city characteristics. This raises the question of the extent to which city characteristics can contribute to the explanation of youth delinquency, above and beyond the influence of neighbourhood and individual characteristics. To answer this question we first discuss how previous macro-level research explains city differences in crime rates, and then we test whether there is empirical evidence that youth delinquency differs not only between individuals but also between neighbourhoods and, moreover, between cities. Using data collected among 12-17-year-old adolescents from 11 Dutch cities, multilevel analyses revealed that there is a substantial amount of variance to be explained at the city level, even after controlling for composition effects and differences between surveys. In contrast with previous research studying neighbourhood influences on youth delinquency but neglecting the city level, we found very little variance at the neighbourhood level. Possible explanations and implications for future research are given by linking explanations at the different levels.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is accumulating evidence that greater availability of green space in a neighbourhood is associated with health benefits for the local population. One mechanism proposed for this association is that green space provides a venue for, and therefore encourages, physical activity. It has also been suggested that socio-economic health inequalities may be narrower in greener areas because of the equalised opportunity for physical activity green spaces provide. However, research exploring associations between the availability of green space and physical activity has produced mixed results. Limits to the assessment of the type and amount of physical activity which occurs specifically in green space may account for these mixed findings. This observational study was therefore concerned with the extent to which green space is a venue for physical activity and whether this could account for narrower socio-economic health inequalities in greener neighbourhoods.\n\nMETHOD: Secondary analysis of cross sectional data on 3679 adults (16+) living in urban areas across Scotland matched with a neighbourhood level measure of green space availability. Associations between green space availability and both total physical activity, and activity specifically within green space, were explored using logistic regression models. Interactions between socio-economic position and physical activity were assessed. All models adjusted for age, sex and household income.\n\nRESULTS: The availability of green space in a neighbourhood was not associated with total physical activity or that specifically in green space. There was no evidence that income-related inequalities in physical activity within green space were narrower in greener areas of Scotland.\n\nCONCLUSION: Physical activity may not be the main mechanism explaining the association between green space and health in Scotland. The direct effect of perceiving a natural environment on physiological and psychological health may offer an alternative explanation.

AB  - A significant milestone was recently passed, with the majority of\nhumankind now living in cities. For the first time in the history of our\nspecies, the immediate human environment will primarily be the built\nenvironment. Accelerating urbanization does not change the fact,\nhowever, that human beings ultimately remain dependent on the\nenvironment. Cities and their growth will necessarily become major\ndrivers of environmental and ecological change, and global sustainable\ndevelopment will therefore be inextricably tied to the development of\ncities.\nAs a global term, `sustainability' attempts to balance myriad social,\neconomic, and environmental factors, and is so complex in its\napplication that a simple directive is useful to condense the\ndiscussion. As Wheeler succinctly describes it, sustainable urban\ndevelopment `improves the long term social and ecological health of\ncities and towns.' 1 As cities are the major consumers of natural\nresources and the major producers of pollution and waste, it follows\nthat if they can be designed and managed so that resource use and\npollution are reduced, a major contribution to the solution of the\nglobal problem can be achieved. 2 Urban areas will always be net\nconsumers of resources, and major degraders of the environment, however,\nit may be possible to move toward a greater degree of sustainability.\nThe question that this paper will address is whether the spatial built\nform of a city can affect its sustainability, what this relationship may\nentail, and what metrics might exist to help guide the growth of cities.\nDifferent points of view will be explored, illustrating the lack of\nconsensus that exists on certain `truths.' The relative sustainability\nof, for example, high and low urban densities is still disputed. Certain\nurban forms may appear to be more sustainable in some respects, for\nexample in reducing travel, but detrimental in others, perhaps in\nharming the environment or producing social disparities. Some forms may\nbe sustainable in a local sense, but not on a larger scale.\nIf advances in urban sustainability are to be made, then a connection\nbetween urban form and a range of elements needs to be established. How\nare issues of urban size, shape, density, and compactness, urban block\nlayout and size, housing type, green space distribution, to be guided\nalong a sustainable path? What is in fact sustainable urban form? How\ncan it be achieved? I propose to investigate many of these questions by\nresearching current debates and points of view, together with evaluating\na popular and accessible urban sustainability metric to see if it can\nmeaningfully guide sustainable urban form.\nLEED for Neighbourhood Development is a planning metric for urban\nsustainability and contains a normative set of `building blocks' for\nsustainable urban form, in the form of a checklist of components. A\nreview of this planning metric for community sustainability will be\nundertaken, as it relates to urban form, as well as inherent biases that\nmay exist. Strengths and weaknesses of this system will be evaluated,\nwith examples of designed and built communities broadly evaluated. The\nissue of how LEED-ND may be able to affect urban form will be explored,\nand whether it has a deep enough reach to be transformative. How this\nrating system can be used to measure and compare urban forms will be\nexplored, as well as the ability of this rating system to encompass\nbalanced social, economic, and environmental factors. A key issue is\nwhether this, and other rating systems, can truly reverse dominant\ntrends, or whether they are doomed to create `sustainable islands in\nseas of unsustainability.'(3)

AB  - This paper demonstrates the strong relationship between urban morphology and urban design within the Italian traditions of architecture and urbanism. Attention is focused on the work of architects and urban planners during the twentieth century; the period in which urban morphology and urban design emerged in Italy. A common cultural background shared by all those contributing to the field is the concept of ‘type’ and the assertion of a close connection between urban morphology and building typology. In contrast; different positions emerge in the interpretation of what the contemporary city should be; and this has; in turn; had an influence on the analysis of urban form. For this reason the typological debate in Italy has always had a strong ideological component. Instead of a common attempt at mutual understanding; urban morphology has been strongly characterized by a systematic; reciprocal misunderstanding among its followers. This paper attempts to define the multiplicity of cultural positions within the field according to the particular design and planning goals of those positions; in the conviction that the complexity of the current urban phenomenon can no longer be confronted from a single point of view.

In Study I there were no relationships between analogical problem solving and Raven’s Progressive Matrices. Study 2 showed that field-independent subjects were more likely to be analogical solvers than field-dependent subjects. Study 3 failed to support the notion of a link between analogical transfer and right-left and verbal-visual styles of thinking. There was evidence that rates of analogical solutions were higher in adaptors than in innovators (Study 4) and in bio-medical than in humanities students (Study 5). Males tended to give analogical solutions more frequently than females. Results suggest that cognitive styles, rather than abilities, are involved in analogical problem solving.

AB  - Urban form is studied in a variety of disciplines in Ireland, but it has not, until recently, been central to urban studies. Histories of individual towns have usually been preoccupied with political, socio-economic and cultural issues. Archaeological excavations have made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Viking and Anglo-Norman towns. Map evidence is good for early-modern plantation towns. The Irish historic towns atlas provides detailed cartographic and topographical information for a growing number of towns within a chronological and thematic framework. Urban form is often considered as a container for socio-economic processes or as a marker in the search for cultural identity. Architectural studies have focused by and large on buildings of importance. While no Irish scholar has in a strict sense adopted Conzen's method of town-plan analysis, there is evidence for the emergence of a new focus on the fabric of the urban area rather than on the special event represented by the particular building. The 'cultural turn' in the social sciences has favoured discussions on town plans as ideological constructs and on the importance of urban space for civic society. There appears to be an increasingly strong morphological perspective in urban studies which is likely to be a reaction to the loss of historical fabric in the context of large-scale urban renewal schemes. © International Seminar on Urban Form, 2008.

AB  - The introduction of the concept of urban density\n\ncan be traced back to the Garden City movement in\n\nEngland and the early modernists in Germany.\n\nReactions to the conditions of the late-nineteenthcentury\n\nEuropean city rested on the observation that\n\ntoo many people, dwellings, and workplaces\n\ncombined with too little air, light and open space\n\nresulted in, among other things, social deprivation,\n\nill health and crime. The concept of density proved\n\nto be useful to describe these conditions and\n\nprescribe alternatives, often in the form of low\n\ndensities in decentralized environments. Examples\n\nof this are the garden cities in Great Britain and\n\nSweden, the Siedlungen in Germany, and the move\n\nto the suburbs in North America (R�dberg, 1988).

AB  - This study examined the relationship between emotional intelligence, anxiety and depression among adolescents. Two hundred and fifty high-school students were administered the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS), a self-report measure of emotional intelligence, along with measures of thought suppression, self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. It was hypothesized that emotional abilities would predict psychological adjustment above and beyond factors that have been previously associated with poor adjustment (i.e., self-esteem and thought suppression). The study revealed two main findings. First, self-reported ability to regulate mood (Emotional Repair) was positively related to self-esteem. Second, self-reported emotional intelligence was negatively related to levels of depression and anxiety. Specifically, the ability to discriminate clearly among feelings (Emotional Clarity) and the ability to self-regulate emotional states were associated with better psychological adjustment, independent of the effects of self-esteem and thought suppression. The results provide support for the hypothesis that emotional abilities are an important and unique contributor to psychological adjustment.

AB  - This paper discusses the tangible effects of economic and cultural globalisation at the neighbourhood level in Budapest, Hungary. Rather than examining local/national economic and cultural traits, it considers the impacts of capital investments, architectural influences, immigrant groups and cultural changes in the residential space. The spatial distribution of these impacts in Budapest suggests that global processes not only steer neighbourhood development but that they do so differentially. That is, certain aspects of globalisation tend to appear in specific neighbourhoods, where they affect local development to different degrees. In Budapest, we find that a neigh- bourhood’s relative location, image and socio-economic characteristics are the factors that influence the outcome most. The analysis interprets the way globalisation affects local development from the perspective of critical real- ism, an approach combining various methodologies. To highlight the nature of the global-local interplay, the study is framed by a general model of neighbourhood transformation.

AB  - A random sample of 9-11-year-old children living in 18 suburbs of Sydney, Australia, were interviewed regarding their likes and dislikes about their neighbourhood, and their overall evaluation of their area as a "place for children to grow up in". The 18 suburbs were selected to represent a range of scores on the Vinson-Homel risk scale, a composite index of neighbourhood quality derived from health, income, employment, education and welfare statistics that are available on an areal basis. Children's evaluations were strongly related to areal risk scores, with the two highest-risk (inner city) neighbourhoods particularly disfavoured. The major reasons advanced for liking or disliking a neighbourhood were plotted against risk scores, showing a complex pattern of associations, with parks particularly valued by children in the highest-risk areas. A canonical correlation analysis of likes, dislikes and overall ratings showed two canonical variables to be statistically significant. The first was a good-bad dimension, which was strongly associated with risk score. The second contrasted open playspace with private peace and quiet, bringing together the six highest- and lowest-risk areas in comparison to the twelve middling-risk areas. No variables other than risk were found to be predictive of children's evaluations of their neighbourhoods.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study examined the prevalence of body dissatisfaction as a function of individual level and neighbourhood level indicators of affluence. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: A subset of data from a larger random digit dialling telephone survey was used to obtain individual level data on body dissatisfaction, body weight and height, and income from a group of 895 adult women (age 24-56, 61% English speaking) living in 52 neighbourhoods (census tract areas) within the provinces of Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada who were selected for their heterogeneity in social class. DESIGN: Aggregated census tract data from 1996 were used to develop neighbourhood indicators of affluence. Using hierarchical linear modelling, body dissatisfaction (dichotomous) was examined as a function of individual body mass index, individual level affluence and neighbourhood level affluence. MAIN RESULTS: The impact of body mass index on body dissatisfaction depended on the level of neighbourhood affluence: an average body mass index was associated with higher likelihood of reporting body dissatisfaction in a neighbourhood of above average affluence (71% probability) than in a neighbourhood of average affluence (58% probability), independent of a woman's individual affluence (whether she was low income or not). CONCLUSION: It is concluded that a clearer understanding of the role of affluence on body dissatisfaction can be achieved by a joint examination of individual and neighbourhood level influences.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation between neighbourhood socioeconomic and ethnic characteristics with depressive symptoms in a population based sample. DESIGN: Cross sectional data from the CARDIA study, including the Center for Epidemiological Studies depression scale score (CES-D). Neighbourhoods were 1990 US census blocks of 1000 people; six census variables reflecting wealth/income, education, and occupation investigated separately and as a summary score; neighbourhood racial composition (percentage white and black) and individual level income and education were also examined. SETTING: Participants recruited in 1985/86 from community lists in Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis MN; from a health plan in Oakland, CA. PARTICIPANTS: 3437 adults aged 28-40 years in 1995/96: 24% white men, 27% white women, 20% black men, 29% black women. MAIN RESULTS: For each race-sex group, CES-D was inversely related to neighbourhood score and individual income and education. Associations of neighbourhood score with CES-D became weak and inconsistent after adjusting for individual level factors; personal income remained strongly and inversely associated with CES-D. Age adjusted mean differences (standard errors) in CES-D between the lowest and highest income categories were 3.41 (0.62) for white men, 4.57 (0.64) for white women, 5.80 (0.87) for black men, and 5.74 (0.83) for black women. For both black and white participants, CES-D was associated negatively with percentage of white people and positively with percentage of black people in their census block, before, but not after, adjustment for individual and neighbourhood socioeconomic variables. CONCLUSIONS: Neither neighbourhood socioeconomic characteristics nor ethnic density were consistently related to depressive symptoms once individual socioeconomic characteristics were taken into account.

High-resolution thermal imagery collected by the National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) is used in conjunction with parcel-level tax records to examine the interaction between the design of single-family residential parcels and the emission of radiant heat energy. Re-suits from a path analysis illustrate that lower density patterns of residential development contribute more radiant heat energy to surface heat island formation than higher density development patterns within the Atlanta region. Compact moderate-to-high-density new construction and area-based tree ordinances are recommended as policy strategies for mitigating the effects of urban development on regional climate change.

AB  - It is well established that neighbourhood quality is related to various aspects of people's health and coping, especially in old age. There have also been a few reports on the links between self-reported neighbourhood quality and quality of life in older age. However, it is not clear which aspects of quality of life in particular are related to neighbourhood quality and whether these associations are independent of the roles of cognitive, socioeconomic or health status, or rating biases. Using a large sample of Scots from the Edinburgh area (. N = 1091, of whom 548 were men) aged between 68 and 71 years, this study shows direct associations of objectively and comprehensively determined neighbourhood deprivation with self-perceived quality of life in physical and environmental domains, but not in psychological or social relationship domains. In a path model, these associations were independent of the roles of childhood cognitive ability and change in it to age 70, educational attainment, and occupational social class. The count of adverse health conditions (cardiovascular disease, stroke history, high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis) was associated with both quality of life and neighbourhood deprivation, and mediated the indirect links from neighbourhood deprivation to physical, psychological and environmental domains of quality of life.

AB  - The relationship of individual differences, perceptions of lying in everyday life and perceptions of lying in a high stakes scenario (plagiarism at University) was investigated. It was expected that the personality constructs of Acting, Manipulativeness, Impression Management and Sociability would be positively related to a perceived ability to lie in everyday life and in a high stakes scenario, and that the construct of Anxiousness would be negatively related to the perceived ability to lie in everyday life and in a high stakes scenario. Undergraduate students (n = 265) were administered five personality construct measures, and a series of questions and statements concerning perceptions of lying in everyday life and in a high stake situation. In everyday life, there were significant findings for Acting and Manipulativeness in relation to perceptions of experiencing little guilt and mental effort whilst lying, experiencing duping delight, finding lying easy and that the lies are undetectable. Significant findings were also yielded for Anxiousness and Sociability, in relation to perceptions of feeling guilty and of manipulating others while lying. The hypotheses regarding Impression Management was rejected. In the high stake scenario there were significant findings for Manipulativeness in relation to the perceptions of feeling comfortable (before, during and after) the lie, being believed by the target of the lie and perceiving the situation better dealt with a lie rather than the truth, and Anxiousness in relation to planning the lie and being uncomfortable while lying. They hypotheses regarding Acting, Sociability and Impression Management were rejected. The implications for future research on individual differences and deceptive behaviour are discussed.

AB  - Geographical inequalities in health are omnipresent with health and related behaviours typically worse in socioeconomically deprived places. However, this is not always true. Deprived places with unexpectedly good health outcomes, or what might be considered 'resilient' places, have been noted. Few studies have quantitatively examined resilience in neighbourhoods or investigated potential explanations for this resilience. This paper examines the paradox of low mortality despite high social deprivation in New Zealand neighbourhoods and considers possible neighbourhood characteristics that contribute to unanticipated positive health outcomes. Using area-level mortality (2005-2007) and socioeconomic data, we developed the Resilience Index New Zealand to quantify neighbourhood levels of resilience across the country. We then examined relationships between this measure and a suite of built, physical and social characteristics. We found that resilient places tended to be densely populated, urban areas. We observed gradients and increases/decreases in the most resilient groups in access to or levels of physical environment factors (environmental deprivation, safe drinking water, air quality) and unhealthy living infrastructure (alcohol and gambling outlets). Since these factors are amenable to change, these findings are the strongest evidence that such improvements may lower mortality in similarly deprived places. The social environment of resilient areas was characterised by high levels of incoming residents. We also found some surprising associations and observed U-shaped relationships for a number of the neighbourhood factors. Such findings suggest the need to develop a better proxy of community cohesion and a better understanding of the interactions between people and their neighbourhoods, rather than simply the presence of certain factors. We argue that this study has identified amenable neighbourhood characteristics and highlighted the importance of 'place-specific' resilience factors that may be effective in reducing mortality in some neighbourhoods, but be less effective in others. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: The effects of family and place on health outcomes may be seriously misestimated by standard analytic techniques. The information-rich settings in several Canadian provinces can provide appropriate designs to minimize biases resulting from omitted variables and measurement error. This paper compares siblings with children living in the same neighbourhood (but not in the same family) in terms of health care utilization and health care costs. A complete history of residential mobility since birth permits an estimate of the effects of exposure to different environments. Methods: Registry data from a Manitoba cohort born between 1978 and 1985 and continuously resident in the province generated a large sample of same-sex siblings and neighbours (N = 18,280). Administrative information on physician billings, hospital inpatient stays, and costs provided data on utilization between ages 12 and 17. Results: Large effects on the outcome variables were associated with being in the same family (correlations up to 0.50), whereas the correlations representing upper limits on neighbourhood effects were usually small. These neighbourhood correlations typically shrank slightly after adjustment for family effects. Higher neighbour correlations with utilization (particularly ambulatory visits) occurred in rural Manitoba and probably reflect variation in access to care. Higher correlations are associated with relatively small neighbourhoods and with families remaining in the neighbourhood for at least 17 years. Discussion: Although specific variables taken from administrative data are only marginally predictive, our results emphasize the importance of "family" in affecting health care utilization in Manitoba. The minimal effects of neighbourhood differ from those found by investigators generally using weaker designs and emphasizing the significance of neighbourhood.

AB  - The understanding of needs aspect is important. A lot of people share common needs, but by identifying each person's unique needs will help answer why people use a particular space in the first place. Various studies also confirms the link between high quality green spaces with the increased property value; benefits in improving the image of an area as to attract investment; contribution to biodiversity; contribution in promoting physical activities and the benefits to health; and finally overcoming the anti-social behavior through design and management. The purpose of this review paper is to help fill in gaps that more methods are required for evaluating projects so as to obtain high quality evidence for better outdoor recreational venues such as neighbourhood parks.This review suggests that natural settings, safety, aesthetic appeal, convenience, psychological comfort, and symbolic ownership, policy on use, cost and interaction with natural environment are significantly important to park users' needs attributes relating to the design of a neighbourhood green open space. This paper provides a critical review of past and current research and its theoretical fundamentals on park users needs for a successful or a quality neighbourhood green open spaces. It should be of interest to landscape architects, park designers, urban designers, city planners, architects, developers as well as any other professional involved in the development of new residential neighbourhoods.

AB  - This study seeks to contribute to a more complete understanding of how urban form influences biodiversity by investigating the effects of green area distribution and that of built form. We investigated breeding bird diversity in three types of housing development with approximately the same amount of tree cover. No significant differences in terms of bird communities were found between housing types in any of the survey periods. However, detached housing, especially with interspersed trees, had more neotropical insectivores and higher overall diversity of insectivores. Based on our results and theory we suggest a complementary approach to managing biodiversity in urban landscapes - instead of maximising the value and quality of individual patches efforts could go into enhancing over-all landscape quality at the neighbourhood scale by splitting up part of the green infrastructure. The relatively small differences in bird communities also suggest that different stakeholder groups may be engaged in management. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - In recent years health science seems to have taken a “spatial turn” with a renewed interest in spatially oriented research. There are a number of reasons behind this rediscovery of “the power of maps”. One of the predominant drivers has been the development of Geographical Information Systems (GIS), software systems that can handle geographically referenced data. GIS is a very helpful tool to characterise neighbourhoods for a wide range of health-related studies. However, neighbourhoods can be defined in many different ways, and modifying the area unit used to delineate a neighbourhood affects the results of analyses. It is important for researchers to be aware of the effect the choice of neighbourhood can have on the analyses. A first fundamental step using GIS in health science is to have a good conceptual understanding of which physical environment to study exactly in relation to which health outcome or health behaviour. With a good conceptual understanding of the neighbourhood in focus, numerous meaningful variables can be derived from a GIS, as a series of examples demonstrates in this chapter. However, the quality of the parameters and analyses is highly dependent on the quality and scale of the available GIS data. With the increased use of GIS, the limitations of existing GIS data are becoming more apparent. However, we expect that methodological and technical developments will increase the usefulness and validity of using GIS-derived environmental parameters in health research, which in turn will increase the use of GIS in the future.

AB  - This paper demonstrates the strong relationship between urban morphology and urban design within the Italian traditions of architecture and urbanism. Attention is focused on the work of architects and urban planners during the twentieth century, the period in which urban morphology and urban design emerged in Italy. A common cultural background shared by all those contributing to the field is the concept of type and the assertion of a close connection between urban morphology and building typology. In contrast, different positions emerge in the interpretation of what the contemporary city should be, and this has, in turn, had an influence on the analysis of urban form. For this reason the typological debate in Italy has always had a strong ideological component. Instead of a common attempt at mutual understanding, urban morphology has been strongly characterized by a systematic, reciprocal misunderstanding among its followers. This paper attempts to define the multiplicity of cultural positions within the field according to the particular design and planning goals of those positions, in the conviction that the complexity of the current urban phenomenon can no longer be confronted from a single point of view.

AB  - The 20th century began with the re-discovery of Mendel's laws of heredity; the 21st century began with the Human Genome Project's working draft of the human genome sequence. We are rapidly approaching a postgenomic era in which we will know the entire genome sequence and, most importantly to individual differences researchers, all the DNA variations in the genome sequence. These DNA polymorphisms are the source of hereditary influence and will revolutionise genetic research on individual differences. Although attention is now focused on finding genes for complex quantitative traits, the greatest impact on individual differences research will come after genes have been identified. The future of genetic research on individual differences lies in moving from finding genes (genomics) to finding out how genes work (functional genomics). Functional genomics is usually equated with bottom-up molecular biology at the cellular level of analysis. However, a top-down psychological level of analysis (behavioural genomics) is likely to pay off more quickly in diagnosing and treating and especially predicting and preventing societally important problems. Bottom-up and top-down levels of analysis of gene-behaviour pathways will eventually meet in the brain. The grandest implication is that DNA will integrate individual differences research across the life sciences. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The first section of the paper looks at the development of the historic walled city in the seventeenth century, when the pre-modern hydrological landscape included a system of underground canals, surface canals, stepped wells, ponds, tanks, and household wells. The second section examines the transformations under British colonial rule in the nineteenth century with the introduction of piped water supply, water closets, and sanitary engi- neering. In addition to the engineering skills and funds required to put the new systems in place, these new technologies required a rationalized and efficient legal and administrative apparatus to deliver them. Not only was the knowledge not local, but the institutions and administrative mechanisms they required were also imposed as an import. The third and fourth sections look at two different post-colonial (post 1947) landscapes of Delhi. The third section focuses on the rapid prolifera- tion of slums and squatter settlements in the city and conflicted efforts by the state and community development agencies to improve water and sanita- tion provisions for these settlements. The fourth section looks at the recent mushrooming of private townships devoted to global corporate offices and housing for a new generation of global corporate elites. Large-scale devel- opment projects such as DLF City or Gurgaon in metropolitan New Delhi, were established on agricultural land and depend heavily on groundwater that is now at a perilous low in the entire urban area of Delhi. Through a historical perspective on Delhi’s development, I identify five key transformations in the cultural landscape of water: (1) the geographies of access, (2) the technologies of extraction and distribution, (3) the socio- economic organization of water, (4) institutional structures and governance mechanisms, and (5) water’s symbolic significance.

AB  - The tropics is the geographical zone farthest from polar ice sheets, and has been little affected by glacioisostatic processes during the glacial cycles of the later Quaternary. Consequently, the sea-level history in the tropics is unique and reflects to a great extent the eustatic change of sea level. In the tropics, there are many proxy records suitable for reconstructing former sea-level positions. In particular, reef-building corals, mangrove peat, beachrock, and tubeworms are all good sea-level indicators and they have been widely used in the reconstruction of postglacial sea-level history. Despite the great wealth of sea-level data collected across the tropics, the best sets of sea-level data come from the region between the Australian and Asian continents, as well as the Caribbean. The sea-level data from the continental shelf of north Australia and the Sunda Shelf of southeast Asia, together with the sea-level data from the Strait of Malacca, are used to reconstruct a complete sea-level curve representative of the tropics for the past 20kyr. It shows the position of the sea-level lowstand for the Last Glacial Maximum, phases of rapid rise of sea-level, and the mid-Holocene sea-level highstand. The sea-level curve not only reveals the eustatic sea level history, but also provides useful information about the characteristics of ice sheet melting, thus useful constraints to geophysical models.

AB  - The paper describes the scope, purpose, and effectiveness of a required class on the subject of urban form. The course condenses material from urban design, planning history, and urban and historical geography. In order to practice urban design and planning, students must be prepared to intervene in an ongoing urbanization process which is not altogether in their or anyone's control. The goal of the course is for students to acquire 1) substantive knowledge of processes of city building-an understanding of the evolution of city form, of the historical basis of the contemporary city, and of the cultural differences between cities-and 2) analytical skills to measure and interpret urban form as it affects access to services, life style, and, eventually, quality of life. The morphogenetic approach serves as the theoretical basis of the course. Its strength lies in its explanation of che characteristics of urban form as the product of city-building processes. Students gain fluency in the vocabulary of forms. They are trained to visualize and measure actual elements of form and to compare their performance.

AB  - The present study examined whether the mechanism that links working memory capacity (WMC) and controlled attention is better construed as suppression of distracting information or as efficient selection of critical information, in the face of distraction. We examined WMC-related differences in the Stroop task, in which participants must ignore word-information and instead name the hue in which a word has been printed. The present Stroop task included several neutral words (i.e., non-color) that were subsequently incorporated in a recognition memory test. Participants were either warned or not warned of this test. High WMC individuals who were warned displayed better memory of neutral words, relative to the no-warning group; suggesting they had actively monitored Stroop-words for relevant information. However, this increased attention to word-content was not associated with increased Stroop interference. We conclude that WMC-related attention is more flexible than early or late selection accounts suggest. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In practice, however, the extent of public participation ranges from situations in which the concept has been actively incorporated into the urban policy and planning process to those in which planners and decision-makers pay only lip-service to the ideal. This paper examines recent evidence from Britain and North America and addresses the question of the extent to which residents can influence the character of their neighbourhoods. A range of possible strategies for public participation is reviewed, and an improved neighbourhood council model suggested as the most realistic means of achieving the goal of greater public par- ticipation in the process of neighbourhood change.

AB  - Early research on urban form in Sweden was undertaken before the First World War. After the Second World War research was influenced by the major criticisms levelled at comprehensive urban renewal and suburban mass housing. These criticisms were particularly on the ground that values embodied in the traditional built environment were being ignored. Increased interest in the study of historical urban fabrics was associated with the development of methodologies reliant on the concepts of typology and morphology. These developments were dependent on the activities of individual researchers until the very recent development of wider co-ordinating research organizations.

AB  - This paper intends to show the contribution and relationship of urban form to a liveable city, as many researchers pose the urban form as one of the factors that can worsen or improve the sustainability of the city. The paper will begin by exploring into the theoretical characteristics of the urban form at the macro and micro scale. Urban form models that match the Malaysian cities’ urban form are illustrated in this paper with the idea of giving a larger context of the living ecology for Malaysian communities. There are two types of cities, one that grows in an ad-hoc manner, and the other is being shaped by planners. This paper however, focuses only on a planned city that is the core city for Shah Alam. Consequently, this paper touches briefly on the liveable city concept which is currently being debated among the researchers as a more practical way of looking into the sustainable city issues. The liveable city framework for the city of Shah Alam is discussed and some preliminary findings are offered at the end of the paper.

AB  - This paper deals with the difficult relation between urban form, travel behaviour and sustainable development. In more developed countries, the influence of governments on urban form can be considerable through planning. Modern planning theory focuses mainly on procedural aspects. It is argued in this paper that substantive aspects cannot be neglected if sustainable solutions are being pursued. For making urban land-use planning more sustainable, it is essential to have insight into the relationships between the urban "users" and their surroundings. This is outlined by presenting some survey results on the additional role of the spatial context on household behaviour. The survey was conducted among households in the region of Amersfoort in the Netherlands. The results provide some empirical evidence that household behaviour is related to urban form, although in a complex way. Reasonably more energy-intensive and therefore less sustainable household practices were observed at the urban outskirts more than in the rural area, whereas differences according to neighbourhood building design were inappreciable.

AB  - Study Objective: To investigate the relation between neighbourhood socioeconomic and ethnic characteristics with depressive symptoms in a population based sample. Design: Cross sectional data from the CARDIA study, including the Center for Epidemiological Studies depression scale score (CES-D). Neighbourhoods were 1990 US census blocks of 1000 people; six census variables reflecting wealth/income, education, and occupation investigated separately and as a summary score; neighbourhood racial composition (percentage white and black) and individual level income and education were also examined. Setting: Participants recruited in 1985/86 from community lists in Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis MN; from a health plan in Oakland, CA. Participants: 3437 adults aged 28-40 years in 1995/96: 24% white men, 27% white women, 20% black men, 29% black women. Main Results: For each race-sex group, CES-D was inversely related to neighbourhood score and individual income and education. Associations of neighbourhood score with CES-D became weak and inconsistent after adjusting for individual level factors; personal income remained strongly and inversely associated with CES-D. Age adjusted mean differences (standard errors) in CES-D between the lowest and highest income categories were 3.41 (0.62) for white men, 4.57 (0.64) for white women, 5.80 (0.87) for black men, and 5.74 (0.83) for black women. For both black and white participants, CES-D was associated negatively with percentage of white people and positively with percentage of black people in their census block, before, but not after, adjustment for individual and neighbourhood socioeconomic variables. Conclusions: Neither neighbourhood socioeconomic characteristics nor ethnic density were consistently related to depressive symptoms once individual socioeconomic characteristics were taken into account.

After assessment of individual differences in optimism and the intensity of exercising, participants responded to an immediate and a one-week delayed recall test of personally relevant versus irrelevant information. Regression analyses found in support of the hypothesis that attention to and hence recall of health-related information is determined by the extent of its personal relevance; that relevant health-related information was better remembered than irrelevant information, and that this was especially the case for highly active exercisers. Most important, memory for relevant health-related information was best for highly active exercisers who simultaneously scored high in optimism.

Other work has found that controlling for family level characteristics reduces or eliminates the apparent association between neighbourhood quality and health. We find, measuring both child well-being and neighbourhood quality multi-dimensionally, that even after controlling for family level characteristics neighbourhood quality has strong associations with child well-being.

AB  - We propose that community assessments of environmental impact are increasingly more relevant to planners and policy makers when reported at finer scales of analysis. Using the Town of Oakville, Ontario, as an example, we calculate neighbourhood level ecological footprint values for 241 neighbourhoods. Ecological footprint results range from 5.4 global hectares per capita to 15.2 global hectares per capita, with an average ecological footprint for Oakville of 9.0 global hectares per capita. Our results highlight variability in energy and material flows within a community, providing planners and policy makers detailed information to prioritise programme delivery, allocate limited resources, and support policy development. The lower range of neighbourhood ecological footprint values suggests a potential footprint floor for Oakville of around 5 hectares per capita. The notion of a footprint floor has implications for setting community footprint targets and understanding the magnitude of change needed for significant ecological footprint reductions.

AB  - The present experiment compared information-gathering and accusatory styles of interviewing in terms of respondents' perceptions of their degree of discomfort and cognitive demand, and the extent to which they felt they had been listened to. Forty truth tellers and forty liars were interviewed about an alleged event via an accusatory or information-gathering interview style. Information-gathering interviews were perceived as more cognitively demanding, although accusatory interviews were perceived as making respondents more uncomfortable. Respondents felt that they were listened to more in information-gathering interviews. We also observed several complex patterns relating interview type, individual differences (shyness), truth status (liars vs. truth tellers) and the respondents' perceptions of the interview process. The results challenge some common beliefs about interview styles, namely that information-gathering interviews are easier for suspects than accusatory interviews. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Creation of living environments has always been led by strong ideas guided by social or environmental objectives. Thus, urban form has in the past, for example, been influenced by safety, order, hygiene and health. During the second half of the twentieth century regeneration of cities has often been guided by notions of local character or genius loci, as a reaction to the destruction and brutal transformation following the Second World War. Climate change and potential higher temperatures have increased concerns about urban heat island effect, which is now probably the single most important factor to consider in the design of cities. This concern, however, should not overtake the need to also create places that are attractive to live in. Urban morphology has proved a successful approach to analyse the characteristics of urban environments and in certain cases to inform urban design guidance; this article will explore the possibility and potential of using morphological techniques to identify the key factors to take into consideration that influence microclimate in cities and inform urban design to provide a maximum cooling effect. This would help to create spaces that are more comfortable for residents. This tentative exploration was initiated as part of the author's work on a case study related to an ongoing research project entitled Urban Rivers and Sustainable Living Agenda (URSULA, www.ursula.ac.uk). Hypothetical parameters related to urban morphology are put forward to analyse the climate performance of different urban forms of a riverside location in Sheffield and the micro-climate data collected there. This will contribute to the ongoing research to identify which urban morphology characteristics have the most significant impact on thermal comfort and how they could be manipulated to mitigate the urban heat island effect. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Normative performance on the Bechara-Damasio Gambling Task is highly variable. We investigate whether gamblers will be able to perform better than non-gamblers on the task. A second question that we answer concerns procedure, especially with respect to the instructions. For each group of 42 participants (gamblers, and non-gamblers), 21 received the standard instructions, while 21 were explicitly informed that "some decks are 'better' and some decks are 'worse'." Roughly 60% of the participants exhibited performance indicative of learning, while roughly 40% exhibited poor performance on the task. Neither variation in the instructions nor gambling experience influenced performance. In contrast, a thrill-and-adventure-seeking (TAS) component of sensation seeking was related to relatively poor performance on the task, as was trait impulsivity. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Despite the availability of detailed data for describing cities, there is a shortage of tools that enable standardized analyses of urban areas, and the associated resource consumption. The objective of this research is to contribute to the development of a standardized method for analysis, so that material and energy consumption can be quantified. Analyzing the resource consumption of the built environment is particularly relevant in cities that are rapidly growing, as short-term planning decisions will have long-term consequences for both the quality of life of the inhabitants, and the future energy and material use of the urban area.

A theoretical model is presented which posits that intraurban mobility is a response to housing consumption disequilibrium. Our data and methodology permitted more accurate measurement of disequilibrium than in previous studies, including the disequilibrium arising from neighborhood change. The major conclusion we draw from our results is that households' perceptions of the level of neighborhood quality and its change influence the mobility decisions of both renters and homeowners residing within central cities. Also, in comparison to other measured factors, neighborhood variables were found to be strong mobility predictors regardless of housing tenure. Our results imply that neighborhood improvement policies may succeed in stabilizing inner-city neighborhoods.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effects of family and place on health outcomes may be seriously misestimated by standard analytic techniques. The information-rich settings in several Canadian provinces can provide appropriate designs to minimize biases resulting from omitted variables and measurement error. This paper compares siblings with children living in the same neighbourhood (but not in the same family) in terms of health care utilization and health care costs. A complete history of residential mobility since birth permits an estimate of the effects of exposure to different environments. METHODS: Registry data from a Manitoba cohort born between 1978 and 1985 and continuously resident in the province generated a large sample of same-sex siblings and neighbours (N = 18,280). Administrative information on physician billings, hospital inpatient stays, and costs provided data on utilization between ages 12 and 17. RESULTS: Large effects on the outcome variables were associated with being in the same family (correlations up to 0.50), whereas the correlations representing upper limits on neighbourhood effects were usually small. These neighbourhood correlations typically shrank slightly after adjustment for family effects. Higher neighbour correlations with utilization (particularly ambulatory visits) occurred in rural Manitoba and probably reflect variation in access to care. Higher correlations are associated with relatively small neighbourhoods and with families remaining in the neighbourhood for at least 17 years. DISCUSSION: Although specific variables taken from administrative data are only marginally predictive, our results emphasize the importance of "family" in affecting health care utilization in Manitoba. The minimal effects of neighbourhood differ from those found by investigators generally using weaker designs and emphasizing the significance of neighbourhood.

This study adds to the literature by (i) investigating the relationship between neighbourhood quality and child health, (ii) by utilizing subjective assessments by individuals familiar with the neighbourhood (i.e., the survey respondent and interviewer), and (iii) by utilizing multiple assessments of neighbourhood quality, and (iv) by investigating several measures of health. Other work has found that controlling for family level characteristics reduces or eliminates the apparent association between neighbourhood quality and health. We find, measuring both child well-being and neighbourhood quality multi-dimensionally, that even after controlling for family level characteristics neighbourhood quality has strong associations with child well-being.

Additional structural characteristics, including landscaping and unique architectural style, enhance memory for buildings above and beyond the original features developed by Appleyard. It is also shown that elderly residents use some of the same physical features as younger adults to remember buildings but rely more heavily on historical cues and ease of pedestrian access as salient building characteristics. Memory for the location of structures as a function of physical and sociocultural features is examined. Different structural features influence location memory than influence verbal memory for buildings.-Authors [Journal; 6 photos, 5 tables, 13 refs.; In English]

Findings revealed significant differences between the HA and LA and the HA and LD groups on all of the L1 and L2 measures. No significant differences were found between the LA and LD groups on any of the L1 and L2 measures, and few differences were found between the HA and ADHD groups. Results replicated studies which have shown that L1 literacy skills are important for L2 learning. New findings showed that students classified as ADHD who have average or better L1 skills do well in L2 courses and that L1 literacy differences between high and low achieving L2 learners emerged early in elementary school, providing support for long-term cross linguistic transfer of L1 to L2 skills. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Study 3\nfailed to support the notion of a link between analogical transfer and\nright-left and verbal-visual styles of thinking.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are common after diagnosis of breast cancer. We examined to what extent these are recurrences of previous disorder and, controlling for this, whether shame, self-blame and low social support after diagnosis predicted onset of depression and anxiety subsequently. Method: Women with primary breast cancer who had been treated surgically self-reported shame, self-blame, social support and emotional distress post-operatively. Psychiatric interview 12 months later identified those with adult lifetime episodes of major depression (MD) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) before diagnosis and onset over the subsequent year. Statistical analysis examined predictors of each disorder in that year. RESULTS: Of the patients, two-thirds with episodes of MD and 40% with episodes of GAD during the year after diagnosis were experiencing recurrence of previous disorder. Although low social support, self-blame and shame were each associated with both MD and GAD after diagnosis, they did not mediate the relationship of disorder after diagnosis with previous disorder. Low social support, but not shame or self-blame, predicted recurrence after controlling for previous disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety and depression during the first year after diagnosis of breast cancer are often the recurrence of previous disorder. In predicting disorder following diagnosis, self-blame and shame are merely markers of previous disorder. Low social support is an independent predictor and therefore may have a causal role.

AB  -   Based on a review of key US and European research this paper notes the declining significance of neighbourhood in the formation of social networks.   This results from the fact that previous neighbourhood-based strong ties were those of kin and co-workers which are now largely found outside the neighbourhood.   The neighbourhood relations that remain are weaker ties but still significant in terms of frequency of contact, convivial relations, practical and emergency assistance.   Neighbourhoods that contain a diversity of network contacts tend to be more healthy and successful than ones with similar contacts.   Strong neighbourhood ties are often associated with networks in which links outside the neighbourhood are poor.   Most network contacts are local but not confined to the neighbourhood.   Weak ties that reach out of the neighbourhood are more robust in terms of social capital.   Policy interventions aimed at enhancing neighbourhood social capital should focus on weak ties that reach out of the neighbourhood rather than strong ties within it.

AB  - This article explores the link between information technology (IT) and urban form. It does this by examining recent literature pertaining to two urban theorizing traditions: the deconcentration and economic-restructuring schools. Whereas in the deconcentration school, IT-urban form relationships are the newest stage in a sequence of technological innovations in transportation and communications posing new challenges to the geography of accessibility, in the restructuring school, these relationships are theorized as pervasive sociotechnical change transforming the organization of production, institutions, and everyday life. Despite their paradigmatic differences, both schools explore urban decentralization and/or centralization questions and identify urban dispersing effects related to synergies between IT and the automobile society. The author uses a Dutch and a U.S. case to illustrate the challenges that informational or New Economy development pose to urban and regional planning.

In particular, we examine the extent to which individual differences in anger-related behaviors are multidimensional (that is, behavior- and/or situation-specific), and how the resulting individual differences dimensions relate to traditional dispositional variables. For this purpose, participants were asked to recall anger instances in which they had been angry with someone else, who was either of a higher, an equal, or a lower status. Next, they were asked to indicate, for each recalled situation, the degree to which they had wanted to display and had actually displayed each of a set of eight anger-related behaviors. Subsequently, they completed dispositional questionnaires. The results clearly demonstrated that there are considerable and multidimensional individual differences in anger-related behaviors that primarily pertain to three different behavior domains: external aggression, tension reduction, and communication. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

By dividing self-regulation into assessment (i.e., the tendency to judge the quality of something by considering both its merits and demerits in comparison with an alternative) and locomotion (i.e., the tendency to move from state to state, with committing the psychological resources to pursue goals), this study compared these different aspects of self-regulation with symptoms of impulsivity, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in a non-clinical sample of 330 participants. Results indicate a positive relationship between assessment scores and impulsivity and a negative association between locomotion and impulsivity. Results also indicate that assessment is positively associated with anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Collectively, these results suggest that poor self-regulation in the form of high assessment scores may play a role in a range of impulsive and compulsive related disorders.

AB  - Early research on urban form in Sweden was undertaken before the First World War. After the Second World War research was influenced by the major criticisms levelled at comprehensive urban renewal and suburban mass housing. These criticisms were particularly on the ground that values embodied in the traditional built environment were being ignored. Increased interest in the study of historical urban fabrics was associated with the development of methodologies reliant on the concepts of typology and morphology. These developments were dependent on the activities of individual researchers until the very recent development of wider co-ordinating research organizations.

In analysing the layout and the building fabric of towns their most important tool was the town plan. This period was followed by periods during which urban functions and urban structures were the major concerns of urban geographers. However, in the second half of the twentieth century there were again innovative contributions to the study of urban form, stimulated by the activities of architects and urban historians, the research of British geographers, such as A.E.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purposes of this study are to determine (i) if neighbourhood socioeconomic status (SES) is systematically related to the prevalence of overweight children and youth in Canada, (ii) if the factors accounting for the apparent relationship have face validity, and (iii) if neighbourhood SES has an independent influence on this distribution. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from Cycle 4 (2000/2001) of the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth were used. Children and youth aged 5 to 17 were included. Overweight was established using age and sex cut-off points. Neighbourhood socioeconomic data were obtained from the Statistics Canada 2001 Dissemination Area databases and SES quartiles constructed using a composite of socio-economic variables. Hierarchical non-linear modelling was used to test for independent neighbourhood effects. RESULTS: A gradient of increasing overweight prevalence by decreasing neighbourhood SES quartiles was observed (24% high SES, 30% mid-high SES, 33% mid-low SES, 35% low SES). Controlling for individual age, gender, family income and education hierarchical analysis found that a child's odds of being overweight increases if living in a low versus a high SES neighbourhood (OR=1.29, 95% CI=1.14-1.46). INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of child and youth overweight in Canada is inversely and statistically significantly related to neighbourhood SES. Independent effects indicate that neighbourhood characteristics directly influence the odds of being overweight. This research suggests that consideration of opportunity structures that exist in different types of neighbourhoods is fundamentally important to health promotion and disease prevention strategies.

AB  - The personal and social costs of concentrating low-income (typically minority) households in neighbourhoods with high proportions of similarly disadvantaged households has long been of concern in the U.S. In this chapter, Galster explores four federal housing programs tasked with reducing poverty concentrations over the last 25 years: (1) scattered-site public housing; (2) tenant-based Housing Choice Vouchers (HCV); (3) private developments subsidized through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC); and (4) mixed-income redevelopment of distressed public housing estates (HOPE VI). Based on a synthesis of the evidence, four conclusions are drawn. Residents of U.S. public housing on average reside in significantly more disadvantaged neighbourhoods compared to participants in any other assisted housing program. Residents of other types of site-based assisted housing programs (particularly LIHTC) do not reside in significantly different residential environments than tenant-based HCV holders. HCV households live in somewhat lower-poverty neighbourhoods than equivalent households who do not receive housing subsidies, but the comparative differences are more modest for residents in LIHTC units. HCV holders typically do not substantially improve their neighbourhood circumstances with subsequent moves. In understanding how these post-public housing policy efforts have not produced more significant deconcentration of poverty the chapter identifies both the scale and structure of the housing programs, characteristics and needs of residents, and structural barriers. In conclusion, an amalgam of supply-side and demand-side housing program reforms is suggested, coupled with non-housing strategies. Importantly, the US experience offers selective lessons for housing policymakers in Western Europe, though there are vast differences in the origins and policy options available for addressing concentrated poverty.

AB  - Little attention has been paid to date to the role of a changing neighbourhood as a factor influencing the residential choice process. Processes of neighbourhood change are often beyond residents' sphere of influence and if a changing neighbourhood causes residential stress, the only way to improve one's neighbourhood is to move to a better one. This study aims to get more insight into the effect of neighbourhood change on residential stress by studying residents' wish to leave their neighbourhood. Using data from The Netherlands, we show that there is no effect of a change in the socioeconomic status of the neighbourhood on moving wishes. A high level of population turnover and an increase in the proportion of non-Western ethnic minorities in the neighbourhood increase the probability that residents want to leave their neighbourhood.

AB  - This study e xamined the relative contribution of four individual difference variables to ability to solve analogically related problems in four separate problem sequences and for spontaneous and assisted transfer. Experiment 1 inves- tigated the relationships between problem sources and targets, the familiarity of problem sources and targets, and the degree to which subjects spontaneously provided a particular solution to two target problems. Experiment 2 tested whether comb~ations of individual difference variables served as significant predictors of probIem solving success in four different source-target problem sequences. For both spontaneous and assisted transfer, the results indicated that under certain circum- stances different combinations of the tndividual difference variables were contrib- uting to ability to predict whether a subject would provide a particular solution to a target problem. The results are discussed in terms of why the individual difference variables enhance prediction for transfer only under certain conditions. The

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of neighbourhood level socioeconomic status (SES) and convenience store concentration on individual level smoking, after consideration of individual level characteristics. DESIGN: Individual sociodemographic characteristics and smoking were obtained from five cross sectional surveys (1979-1990). Participants' addresses were geocoded and linked with census data for measuring neighbourhood SES and with telephone yellow page listings for measuring convenience store concentration (density in a neighbourhood, distance between a participant's home and the nearest convenience store, and number of convenience stores within a one mile radius of a participant's home). The data were analysed with multilevel Poisson regression models. SETTING: 82 neighbourhoods in four northern California cities. PARTICIPANTS: 8121 women and men aged 25-74 from the Stanford heart disease prevention programme. MAIN RESULTS: Lower neighbourhood SES and higher convenience store concentration, measured by density and distance, were both significantly associated with higher level of individual smoking after taking individual characteristics into account. The association between convenience store density and individual smoking was modified by individual SES and neighbourhood SES. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with a growing body of literature suggesting that the socioeconomic and physical environments of neighbourhoods are associated with individual level smoking.

AB  - Neighbourhood characteristics affect the social and economic opportunities of their residents. Although various studies have analysed housing adjustments at different life stages, little is known about neighbourhood quality adjustments, or movements into 'better' or 'worse' neighbourhoods. On the basis of a model of optimal housing consumption we analyse the determinants of residential mobility and the associated neighbourhood quality adjustments, drawing on data from the British Household Panel Survey and indices of multiple deprivation. We measure quality of neighbourhood both subjectively and objectively and find that not all life course events that are associated with moves lead to neighbourhood quality adjustments. Single people are negatively affected when ceasing to live with parents and couples by a husband's unemployment. Couples having a new baby move into better neighbourhoods.

AB  - Conducted a multilevel investigation of the global self-esteem of 13,022 adolescents in 219 public high schools. The primary objectives were to evaluate the influence of student characteristics and public high school social climate on adolescent global self-esteem in a 1st-stage or micro-model; to evaluate the influence of social climate on the variability of individual differences from school to school in a 2nd-stage or macro-model; and to cross-validate the 1st- and 2nd-stage models to assess generalizability of the findings. Collective well-being and distress were predictors of adolescent esteem in the presence of theoretically important student characteristics. The relationship of social climate to variability of esteem suggests that a positive climate may reduce individual differences within the school.

AB  - The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is commonly used to assess risky decision making in clinical and non-clinical populations, and negative mood and various personality characteristics have been shown to affect the number of advantageous and disadvantageous selections on this task. Recent research has suggested that IGT data should be analyzed at the individual deck level due to differences in frequency and magnitude of losses, and the present study examined how personality characteristics and state mood may affect deck level selections on this task. Participants were 91 undergraduate students (38 male) who completed measures of impulsivity and sensation seeking, behavioral activation and inhibition, state mood, and the computerized IGT. Results indicated that negative mood, drive, impulsivity, and sensation seeking were all positively correlated with Deck B selections, but negatively correlated with Deck D selections. No differences emerged in correlations between Decks A and B or Decks A and D. Results indicate that mood and personality characteristics differentially relate to selections from the individual decks on the IGT. Results have implications for the assessment of decision making, as personality and fluctuations in state-dependent mood could mimic pathological risk-taking if analysis is conducted on the combined decks.

In two experiments, participants listened to a spatial text (Experiments 1 and 2) and a non-spatial text (Experiment 1), at the same time performing a spatial or a verbal concurrent task, or no secondary task. To understand how individuals who differ in spatial ability process spatial text during dual task performance, spatial individual differences were analyzed. The tasks administered were the Vandenberg and Kuse Vandenberg, S. G., & Kuse, A. R. (1978). Mental rotation, a group test of three-dimensional spatial visualization.

Individuals with high (HMR) and low (LMR) mental rotation differed in MRT scores but had similar RCT performance. Results showed that the HMR group, in contrast with LMR counterparts, preserved good spatial text recall even when a spatial concurrent task was performed; however, Experiment 2 revealed a modification of spatial concurrent task performance in LMR as well in HMR group. Overall, results suggest that HMR individuals have more spatial resources than LMR individuals, allowing them to compensate for spatial working memory interference, but only to a limited extent, given that the processing of spatial information is still mediated by VSWM.

AB  - This paper assesses the residential segregation of German immigrants from Turkey, Italy, the Balkans and eastern Europe with a special focus on the link between social and ethnic segregation. Microdata from the German Socioeconomic Panel Study (SOEP) are used. A new dataset provided by the microm Micromarketing-Systeme und Consult GmbH makes accessible information on participants' immediate residential environments at the micro-neighbourhood level where an average neighbourhood contains only eight households. Substantial levels of residential isolation in the form of own-group overexposure are found for all four migrant groups. Based on previous research, an enhanced methodology is proposed to measure the effect of socioeconomic neighbourhood sorting on ethnic residential segregation. It is shown that differences in income, education, language skills and village/city size have the potential to account for 29-84 per cent of the residential isolation of the four migrant groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Canadian cities are becoming more segregated by income. As such, investigation is required into the magnitude of health disparity between low-, average- and high-income neighbourhoods in order to quantify the level of health disparity at the scale of an urban city. METHODS: A cross-sectional ecological study design was used to review all hospital discharges, physician visits, medication utilization, public health information and vital statistics for an entire city by neighbourhood income status. Postal code information was used to identify six existing contiguous residential neighbourhoods in the city of Saskatoon that were defined as low-income cut-off neighbourhoods (N=1 8,228). There were two comparison groups: all other Saskatoon residents (N=184,284) and the five most affluent neighbourhoods in Saskatoon (N=1 6,683). FINDINGS: Statistically significant differences in health care utilization by neighbourhood income status were observed for suicide attempts, mental disorders, injuries and poisonings, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis C, teen birth, low birthweight, infant mortality and all-cause mortality. The rate ratios increased in size when comparing low-income neighbourhoods to high-income neighbourhoods. No clear trend was observed for stroke or cancer.

AB  - The city of Calcutta (renamed Kolkata in 2001) is a stark manifestation of the stereotype of the Third World megacity. Imagined as a “black hole” of poverty, deprivation, disease, and suffering, Calcutta is seen as the quintessential urban problem, in need of reform and intervention. Such a stereotype rests on two key assumptions. First, it is assumed that the “crisis” of the megacity is synonymous with the crisis of poverty and its concentration in slums, squatter settlements, and other types of urban informality − for example Mike Davis’s (2006) apocalyptic narrative of a “planet of slums.” Second, such megacities are assumed to be disconnected from systems of global capitalism and thus understood to be “off the map” − this occurs, for example, in the global cities/world cities framework of Sassen (1991) and others (for an important critique of the global cities framework, see Robinson 2002).

States that just as the earth when viewed from space has no political boundaries or environmental limits, the distinctive lines of scientific research are also beginning to blend, and that interdisciplinary scientific research models with overlapping boundaries also represent an interconnectedness model for the changing roles of subject reference librarians in academic libraries. The model of reference from a desk, resources form a book and a collection defined solely as the contents within a library's walls no longer applies. Examines the shifting landscape in the library references services environment, and considers its impact on both reference librarians and the services they provide.

In Study 1, exploratory factor analyses of responses to a pool of ATG items identified two factors reflecting attitudes about gossip's Social Value (SV) and Moral Value (MV), which provided the basis for constructing a 12-item ATG scale. In Study 2, the SV and MV factors were verified with confirmatory analysis. In Studies 3 and 4, the construct validity of the ATG scale was evidenced by (1) the ability of the SV subscale to predict interest in and intent to transmit gossip, (2) positive correlations with the Tendency to Gossip Questionnaire (Nevo, Nevo, & Derech-Zehavi, 1994) and (3) negative correlations with social approval needs. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The diversity and complexity of human settlements is reflected in the range of ways we try to understand them. The richness of subject matter presented by cities has given rise to an equal richness in methods of investigation. Even within a single field such as urban morphology, there are different approaches with different terms of reference. The challenge raised by the diversity is not how to select between the different views but how to combine and co-ordinate them. The purpose of this paper is to undertake an initial critical analysis of different approaches to urban morphology in an effort to meet that challenge. The first aim is to identify the range of different phenomena taken as the object of urban morphological enquiry. The second is to identify an aspect that is common to all the approaches and that can be used as a reference key to co-ordinate different views in a rigorous way. The ultimate goal is a composite view in which the different approaches support each other to provide a better understanding of human settlements. © International Seminaron Urban Form, 2009.

AB  - Citizen participation in neighbourhood development is one way to promote public health and contribute to the well-being of individuals. However, some people participate while others do not. This study examines the individual characteristics of people who during the past 2 years have participated in a neighbourhood development process compared with potential and non-participants. Socio-demographic factors, perceptions and behaviour were analysed in a cross-sectional study. A questionnaire was answered by 1160 randomly chosen citizens over the age of 18 who lived in three Swedish cities. The most important single factor related to participation in neighbourhood development was prior experience of participation, such as attempting to influence city policies by contacting politicians, submitting a citizen proposal, etc. Furthermore, having frequent political discussions with neighbours was another behavioural factor that was found associated to people's participation in neighbourhood development. Among socio-demographic factors, only ethnicity was found significant after controlling for other factors; i.e. people born outside the Nordic countries were less likely to participate.

Hunkering down is conceptualized and operationalized as: avoiding public spaces, refraining from social contacts and evaluating the neighbourhood unfavourably. Using multi-level modelling based on a representative sample of almost 60,000 persons, individual and contextual characteristics on three levels are linked to three dimensions of (lack of) community cohesion. We found more significant effects of contextual characteristics at the level of neighbourhoods than at the level of municipalities. We found that the concentration of ethnic minorities in the neighbourhood contributes to the explanation of these three dimensions of community cohesion, however, these effects are relatively minor. Moreover, we found that indicators of economic poverty in the neighbourhood similarly determine these dimensions of hunkering down.

AB  - When households move they obviously weigh both the quality of the house and the quality of the neighbourhood in their decision process. But, to the extent that housing quality and neighbourhood quality are inter-twined it is difficult to disentangle the extent to which households are more focused on one or another of these two components of the choice process. This paper uses both cross-tabulations of the neighbourhood choices, and logit models of the actual choices, to examine the relative roles of neighbourhoods and houses in the choice process. The research is focused on the question of the extent to which households trade up in house quality, or neighbourhood quality or both, as outcomes of residential mobility. The research measures neighbourhood quality in both socio-economic and environmental dimensions. The study shows that many households not only move up in housing quality, but quite consistently also make gains in neighbourhood quality, often independently of gains in housing quality. Not surprisingly, the largest gains in neighbourhood quality are related to households who make the city/suburban transition in their housing moves. The research adds another dimension to the growing and extensive literature on neighbourhoods and their role in residential choice. KEY

The moderating impact of mastery and performance goal orientation appears to be much more complex, with initial levels of self-efficacy playing an important role in the interaction between goal orientation and efficacy development.

Many other aspects of their transport and urban form are also conducive to low levels of automobile dependence. However, urban China is changing rapidly with very high rates of motorisation and a number of policies and factors that are pushing their transport systems towards greater reliance on cars and motor cycles. Development of quality public transport systems appears not to be keeping pace with the emphasis on private transport. This paper briefly explores how Chinese cities compared on key transport and urban form factors to a large sample of other cities from around the world in 1995.

AB  - The debate over urban consolidation in Australia has generally ignored the issue of density in the outer urban suburbs of Australian cities, an omission that has led to a serious inconsistency in policy. Governments are emphasising the need for urban intensification in established areas of cities while continuing to allow outer urban areas to be developed at average densities that are among the lowest in the world. Deregulatory policies of the 1990s and an increased reliance on markets have led to increased levels of medium density and high-rise development in Melbourne's inner suburbs and CBD, and broad-scale development in outer suburbs at very low densities. In the process, development companies became the primary determiners of urban form in both inner and outer areas. At the urban fringe, they largely continue to regard intensification, changes to hierarchical retail structures and a reversion to more traditional forms of urban design as a higher commercial risk than proven business-as-usual approaches. This study seeks to place the issue of outer urban densities on the planning agenda of state and local governments. Unless current practices are changed in Melbourne, land set aside in outer urban areas will be used up for housing faster than necessary, and large areas of land squandered. The failure to increase densities in outer urban growth areas will jeopardise compliance with Melbourne 2030 (DOI, 2002a) objectives by preventing the achievement of growth targets in activity centres, and by leading to renewed pressure to remove or substantially alter the Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) and allow further residential development in Melbourne's green bel

AB  - Among the several notions and expressions used in urban morphological description and analysis, complexity is a very common one. Nevertheless it has been used in a quite loose and fuzzy way, never getting enough definition and precision. In this sense, the expression, instead of clarifying descriptions, helps to actually blur them. This paper reports an attempt to give the expression complexity a more precise meaning, and by doing so, offering the possibility to describe and measure it in a more rigorous way, within the boundaries of urban configurational studies. It is assumed an urban system is formed by public spaces and built form units, both described by a number of discrete entities. Both basic components are related to each other through adjacencies, so that the system can be expressed by a graph. Considering that each BFU is reachable from every other through a path formed by public spaces, it can be said that within the system there are a number of virtual spatial interactions between pairs of BFUs, distributed among a number of minimal paths linking them. In this context, it is proposed the concept of complexity as a function of the number of possible pairs of BFUs, on the one hand, and of the number of minimal paths between each pair, on the other. To that extent, complexity is related to quantity and distribution of stocks, and to connectivity of public space network. Maximal complexity is attained by a system configuration in which the stocks distribution gives the maximum number of BFU pairs and the public space network gives the maximum number of minimal paths throughout. From the definition is derived a measure of complexity which offers in a single figure an idea about how a given system is positioned in a known scale.

AB  - The relationship of individual differences, perceptions of lying in everyday life and perceptions of lying in a high stakes scenario (plagiarism at University) was investigated. It was expected that the personality constructs of Acting, Manipulativeness, Impression Management and Sociability would be positively related to a perceived ability to lie in everyday life and in a high stakes scenario, and that the construct of Anxiousness would be negatively related to the perceived ability to lie in everyday life and in a high stakes scenario. Undergraduate students (n - 265) were administered five personality construct measures, and a series of questions and statements concerning perceptions of lying in everyday life and in a high stake situation. In everyday life, there were significant findings for Acting and Manipulativeness in relation to perceptions of experiencing little guilt and mental effort whilst lying, experiencing duping delight, finding lying easy and that the lies are undetectable. Significant findings were also yielded for Anxiousness and Sociability, in relation to perceptions of feeling guilty and of manipulating others while lying. The hypotheses regarding Impression Management was rejected. In the high stake scenario there were significant findings for Manipulativeness in relation to the perceptions of feeling comfortable (before, during and after) the lie, being believed by the target of the lie and perceiving the situation better dealt with a lie rather than the truth, and Anxiousness in relation to planning the lie and being uncomfortable while lying. They hypotheses regarding Acting, Sociability and Impression Management were rejected. The implications for future research on individual differences and deceptive behaviour are discussed. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Their results have been contradictory. This article develops a human ecological critique of these studies by examining the events included in each scenario. The results suggest that these contradictions are more apparent than real: Multinucleation is the most energy-efficient urban form. They also suggest that energy may now be a relatively weak determinant of urban form.

AB  - Study objective: To investigate the relation between neighbourhood socioeconomic and ethnic characteristics with depressive symptoms in a population based sample. Design: Cross sectional data from the CARDIA study, including the Center for Epidemiological Studies depression scale score (CES-D). Neighbourhoods were 1990 US census blocks of 1000 people; six census variables reflecting wealth/income, education, and occupation investigated separately and as a summary score; neighbourhood racial composition (percentage white and black) and individual level income and education were also examined. Setting: Participants recruited in 1985/86 from community lists in Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis MN; from a health plan in Oakland, CA. Participants: 3437 adults aged 28-40 years in 1995/96: 24% white men, 27% white women, 20% black men, 29% black women. Main results: For each race-sex group, CES-D was inversely related to neighbourhood score and individual income and education. Associations of neighbourhood score with CES-D became weak and inconsistent after adjusting for individual level factors; personal income remained strongly and inversely associated with CES-D. Age adjusted mean differences (standard errors) in CES-D between the lowest and highest income categories were 3.41 (0.62) for white men, 4.57 (0.64) for white women, 5.80 (0.87) for black men, and 5.74 (0.83) for black women. For both black and white participants, CES-D was associated negatively with percentage of white people and positively with percentage of black people in their census block, before, but not after, adjustment for individual and neighbourhood socioeconomic variables. Conclusions: Neither neighbourhood socioeconomic characteristics nor ethnic density were consistently related to depressive symptoms once individual socioeconomic characteristics were taken into account.

Children and youth aged 5\nto 17 were included. Overweight was established using age and sex\ncut-off points.

Neighbourhoods were 1990 US census blocks of 1000 people; six census variables reflecting wealth/income, education, and occupation investigated separately and as a summary score; neighbourhood racial composition (percentage white and black) and individual level income and education were also examined. Setting: Participants recruited in 1985/86 from community lists in Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis MN; from a health plan in Oakland, CA. Participants: 3437 adults aged 28-40 years in 1995/96: 24% white men, 27% white women, 20% black men, 29% black women. Main results: For each race-sex group, CES-D was inversely related to neighbourhood score and individual income and education. Associations of neighbourhood score with CES-D became weak and inconsistent after adjusting for individual level factors; personal income remained strongly and inversely associated with CES-D. Age adjusted mean differences (standard errors) in CES-D between the lowest and highest income categories were 3.41 (0.62) for white men, 4.57 (0.64) for white women, 5.80 (0.87) for black men, and 5.74 (0.83) for black women. For both black and white participants, CES-D was associated negatively with percentage of white people and positively with percentage of black people in their census block, before, but not after, adjustment for individual and neighbourhood socioeconomic variables. Conclusions: Neither neighbourhood socioeconomic characteristics nor ethnic density were consistently related to depressive symptoms once individual socioeconomic characteristics were taken into account.

AB  - This article presents research confirming the generalizability of previous research on urban form and memory for buildings. Additional structural characteristics, in- cluding landscaping and unique architectual style, enhance memory for buildings above and beyond the original features developed by Appleyard. It is also shown that elderly residents use some of the same physical features as younger adults to remember buildings but rely more heavily on historical cues and ease of pedestrian access as salient building characteristics. Finally, memory for the location of struc- tures as a function of physical and sociocultural features is examined for the first time in the literature. Different structural features influence location memory than influence verbal memory for buildings.

AB  - This paper traces the history of the study of urban form in Spain, paying special attention to the work of geographers. A periodization is established in which Spanish contributions are related to the growth of towns, urban innovations and foreign intellectual influences. The first period lasted from the second half of the nineteenth century to the Civil War (1936- 39) and preceded the emergence of academic lines of investigation. The second period lasted from the Civil War until the early 1970s, years of great urban growth with little consideration for the historic past of the town. The 1970s were a decade of reorientation. Many important foreign contributions were assimilated, especially those derived from French urban sociology, Anglo-Saxon urban geography, and Italian architecture and urban history. Since the early 1980s a more interdisciplinary perspective has emerged. The most important long-term change has been the development away from an initial dependence on French research to a greater acceptance of other foreign ideas. The study of urban form has become established as an important field among Spanish scholars.

AB  - Until recently, the role of process has been neglected in many geographical diffusion studies, greater attention having been devoted to the simulation of large scale diffusion patterns. This paper examines the process of information diffusion within an ethnically mixed inner city neighbourhood of Vancouver. The information pertained to a Federal aid programme for housing improvement. The impact of official mass media communications concerning the Residential Rehabilitation Assistance Programme was limited, social contact assuming a more important role in the transmission of information. Established relationships, physical proximity and weak associations provided a framework for this interpersonal communication, and the cohesive ethnic network emerged as a particularly significant and efficient medium for the information flow.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effects of family and place on health outcomes may be seriously misestimated by standard analytic techniques. The information-rich settings in several Canadian provinces can provide appropriate designs to minimize biases resulting from omitted variables and measurement error. This paper compares siblings with children living in the same neighbourhood (but not in the same family) in terms of health care utilization and health care costs. A complete history of residential mobility since birth permits an estimate of the effects of exposure to different environments., METHODS: Registry data from a Manitoba cohort born between 1978 and 1985 and continuously resident in the province generated a large sample of same-sex siblings and neighbours (N = 18,280). Administrative information on physician billings, hospital inpatient stays, and costs provided data on utilization between ages 12 and 17., RESULTS: Large effects on the outcome variables were associated with being in the same family (correlations up to 0.50), whereas the correlations representing upper limits on neighbourhood effects were usually small. These neighbourhood correlations typically shrank slightly after adjustment for family effects. Higher neighbour correlations with utilization (particularly ambulatory visits) occurred in rural Manitoba and probably reflect variation in access to care. Higher correlations are associated with relatively small neighbourhoods and with families remaining in the neighbourhood for at least 17 years., DISCUSSION: Although specific variables taken from administrative data are only marginally predictive, our results emphasize the importance of "family" in affecting health care utilization in Manitoba. The minimal effects of neighbourhood differ from those found by investigators generally using weaker designs and emphasizing the significance of neighbourhood.

AB  - This study examined neighbourhood level wildfire mitigation programs being implemented in neighbourhoods in Canada (FireSmart-ForestWise), Australia (Community Fireguard) and the US (Firewise Communities). Semi-structured interviews were completed with 19 residents participating in the programs. A wide range of activities were completed as part of the three programs. Despite differences between the three programs, participants appeared to participate in the programs for three main reasons: Fire experience, agency involvement, and personal and family protection. A fire therefore provides a window of opportunity to engage residents in neighbourhood level wildfire mitigation programs. The neighbourhood level wildfire mitigation programs helped to reduce the wildfire risk, but also enhanced both community resilience and relationships between residents and government agencies. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A Behavioral Communication Questionnaire (BCQ) was developed with an Internet sample (N=247). High alpha reliabilities were obtained in measuring behavioral communication toward three referents: partner, friend, and coworker. Strong positive intercorrelations among these versions of the BCQ suggested that people report consistency in what and how they communicate regardless of with whom they communicate. Scores for behavioral communication correlated expectably with measures of self-esteem, open communication, life distresses, and alexithymia, and were independent of major demographic variables.

AB  - Several studies have reported that neural tube defects (NTD) occur more frequently among children born to women of lower socio-economic status (SES). This study investigated the relationship between individual- and neighbourhood-level SES and the risk of an NTD-affected pregnancy. Data were drawn from a population-based case-control study of fetuses and infants among a cohort of California births between July 1999 and June 2003. Information on individual SES was obtained via telephone interviews with mothers of 337 (76% of eligible) cases and 626 (79% of eligible) non-malformed liveborn controls. Respondents' addresses were linked to the 2000 US Census to characterise six measures of neighbourhood SES (education, poverty, unemployment, occupation, crowding and rental occupancy). The analyses indicated that relative to women with a high school education, those with less than a high school education had a 1.7-fold increased risk of delivering infants with NTDs [95% CI 1.2, 2.6]. Twofold elevated risks for NTDs were observed for women with less than a high school education who lived in neighbourhoods where a majority of residents had not graduated from high school [95% CI 1.3, 3.1]. No consistent risk gradients were observed between NTD-affected pregnancies and indicators of lower neighbourhood SES. Results for phenotype subgroups were similar to those for all cases. Low maternal education was associated with an elevated risk of NTD in offspring. This risk varied by the education profile of the neighbourhood: women who did not graduate from high school and lived in less educated neighbourhoods exhibited a higher risk.

The policy implications of this model for activities designed to promote neighborhood identification and cohesion are outlined, and Granovetter's specific assumptions about the structure and functioning of urban neighborhood social networks are assessed in light of existing research. Little support is found for the presumed absence of bridging weak ties among urban neighbors, or for the assumption that strong ties create an obstacle to effective political mobilization in working-class neighborhoods. An alternative model of local-level integration is suggested, which retains Granovetter's concept of dense clusters of network ties linked by “local bridges”, but re-examines the role of weak ties in effecting such bridges.

AB  - The study of the complex dynamics that engage urban form presents powerful instruments to understand the driving forces of contemporary urban development. This research intends to test traditional urban growth tendencies against informal development mechanisms and decision-making behaviors of competition in geosimulated environments. The empirical objectives are the investigation of the morphological patterns of peripheral poverty and its interactions with urban form, in which accessibility has played important parts sided by informal processes from Latin-American contemporary cities. The paper will present a theoretical review of agent-based models in cellular environments stressing urban growth and decision-making processes as basis for a proposal of a hybrid agent-based model in cellular space. The contemplated model expands the cellular automata approaches by including the interpretation of the model’s landscape by heterogeneous collective agents that settle and promote growth in competitive dynamics according to preferences and hierarchy. The expected result is an urban development intensities landscape, natural features and agent-types concentration, which should allow one to analyze urban form expansion and fragmentation, socioeconomic segregation and urban policies effects. This work succeeds the research by the LabUrb/UFPEL based on the CityCell modelling framework, which has yielded insights on the linkages between urban morphology, social and environmental attributes through emergent urban phenomena simulation focused on temporal and spatial dynamics.

AB  - Perceptual aliasing makes topological navigation a difficult task. In this paper we present a general approach for topological SLAM (simultaneous localisation and mapping) which does not require motion or odometry information but only a sequence of noisy measurements from visited places. We propose a particle filtering technique for topological SLAM which relies on a method for disambiguating places which appear indistinguishable using neighbourhood information extracted from the sequence of observations. The algorithm aims to induce a small topological map which is consistent with the observations and simultaneously estimate the location of the robot. The proposed approach is evaluated using a data set of sonar measurements from an indoor environment which contains several similar places. It is demonstrated that our approach is capable of dealing with severe ambiguities and, and that it infers a small map in terms of vertices which is consistent with the sequence of observations.

AB  - Binary designation of a residential neighbourhood as either traditional or suburban is a distortion of reality, since a location may have some characteristics of both types and since residents in different parts of the neighbourhood may perceive its character differently. This paper presents and applies a methodology for assessing neighbourhood type that results in a measure that is continuous rather than binary, disaggregate rather than aggregate, and potentially multidimensional. Specifically, 18 variables identified by the literature as distinguishing traditional and suburban locations are measured for 852 residents of 5 San Francisco area neighbourhoods. These data are factor-analysed to develop scales on which each individual has a person-specific score. Although we expected a single 'traditionalness' dimension to result, instead we found two factors: traditional and suburban. Study neighbourhoods could and did score highly on both dimensions, and considerable individual variation within neighbourhood was observed. By more accurately capturing the complexity in classifying a neighbourhood and the heterogeneity of individual perception within a neighbourhood, use of this methodology to measure neighbourhood type is expected to improve models involving residential location as an endogenous or exogenous variable.

AB  - Many factors - social and cultural, historical, topographical and functional - influence urban form. Their relationship with the energy resources available to a community at a particular time and the uses to which those resources are put are an important aspect of their combined influence. From this a direct relationship may be drawn between energy and urban form. Little study has been made of it in New Zealand and this report sets out to make an appraisal of that relationship. The opening section briefly discusses the sectorial split of urban energy, discussing direct and indirect energy use in this context. The report then moves on to its general pattern, identifying research in New Zealand and some overseas relevant to particular aspects of urban development. It cites where possible information about the direct and indirect energy components of such development. The topics covered include urban infrastructure (roads, water supply, housing, sewerage, solar heating, etc. and transport - which includes transport networks, variations in population density, work patterns and employment and home occupations. A major difficulty encountered was the absence of energy data specific to urban areas related to either short term or long term usage. This has nullified any effort to compare conservation measures and trade-offs. It is however concluded that two measures could conserve transport and household energy. Transport energy could be saved by ensuring that district and regional planning schemes make adequate provision for social and recreational opportunities and retail outlets at the neighbourhood and suburb level. Compatible commercial and industrial uses located in residential areas would assist in reducing the distances travelled. Permitted increase in residential density adjacent to public transport routes may also assist by increasing the patronage and efficiency of public transport. Careful orientation of domestic buildings in particular would help reduce space heating demand. , NZERDC Contract 3147.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purposes of this study are to determine (i) if neighbourhood socioeconomic status (SES) is systematically related to the prevalence of overweight children and youth in Canada, (ii) if the factors accounting for the apparent relationship have face validity, and (iii) if neighbourhood SES has an independent influence on this distribution. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from Cycle 4 (2000/2001) of the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth were used. Children and youth aged 5 to 17 were included. Overweight was established using age and sex cut-off points. Neighbourhood socioeconomic data were obtained from the Statistics Canada 2001 Dissemination Area databases and SES quartiles constructed using a composite of socio-economic variables. Hierarchical non-linear modelling was used to test for independent neighbourhood effects. RESULTS: A gradient of increasing overweight prevalence by decreasing neighbourhood SES quartiles was observed (24% high SES, 30% mid-high SES, 33% mid-low SES, 35% low SES). Controlling for individual age, gender, family income and education hierarchical analysis found that a child's odds of being overweight increases if living in a low versus a high SES neighbourhood (OR=1.29, 95% CI=1.14-1.46). INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of child and youth overweight in Canada is inversely and statistically significantly related to neighbourhood SES. Independent effects indicate that neighbourhood characteristics directly influence the odds of being overweight. This research suggests that consideration of opportunity structures that exist in different types of neighbourhoods is fundamentally important to health promotion and disease prevention strategies.

The regression of the general factor scores of the ASVAB on the RT measures yielded a shrunken multiple correlation of .465. Although discriminant analyses, when applied separately to the ASVAB subtests and to the RT variables, showed highly comparable overall discrimination between the Black and White groups, factor scores derived from the general factor (labeled speed of information processing) of the RT battery showed only about one-third as large a mean Black/White difference as the mean group difference on the general factor scores derived from the ASVAB. Comparisons were also made between the 106 Ss and 100 university students of higher average academic aptitude who had previously been tested on the same RT battery by the 1st author (see PA, Vol 71:16923). These groups showed marked differences on the RT variables, especially on tests that required more complex cognitive processing. The more complex RT tests also correlated most highly with the psychometric measures of ability within each group. (16 ref) ((c) 1997 APA/PsycINFO, all rights reserved).

AB  - Whereas a variety of research has investigated how individual differences moderate attitude change (persuasion) processes, there is a relative dearth of research investigating how such individual differences moderate behavior change (compliance) processes. The current research assessed the extent to which two well-studied personality traits predicted susceptibility to the mindlessness technique (Langer, Blank, & Chanowitz, 1978). After completing need for cognition and self-monitoring scales, participants were asked to make photocopies for the experimenter. At the copy machine, a confederate asked to cut in line, providing no reason, a real reason, or a placebic reason. Results replicated those of Langer et al. (1978): The placebic reason elicited as much compliance as the real reason. Need for cognition did not moderate compliance, and participants high in self-monitoring were less likely to comply across conditions. In addition, participants who refused the request took significantly longer to respond than participants who complied. Our research therefore provides insight into a largely neglected field of study: How and when individual differences moderate behavior change processes. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To study the associations between neighbourhood level violence/fear of violence and physical activity among elderly people, accounting for somatic health. DESIGN: Self reported data from the Oslo health study, a cross sectional study conducted in 2000, were linked with sociodemographic and social security data from Statistics Norway. A multilevel regression analysis was conducted by MlwiN using contextual level variables provided by the Oslo City Council. SETTING: Oslo, Norway. PARTICIPANTS: 3499 inhabitants aged 74/5 (53.2% of all invitees). MAIN RESULTS: 20.5% of the elderly were physically active less than one hour a week. Somatic health was clearly associated with physical activity among both men and women. Neighbourhood level violence was associated with physical activity only for men, while fear of violence was only associated with physical activity for women. Differences in somatic health did not explain differences in physical activity between neighbourhoods. These differences were explained by socioeconomic variables, and neighbourhood level violence/fear of violence. CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of presumably healthy 75/76 year olds in Oslo, the associations between neighbourhood level violence and physical activity (among men), and fear of violence and physical activity (among women), are of the same sizes as those between somatic health and physical activity. These two dimensions of violence have, in contrast with somatic health, an explanatory function in exploring differences in physical activity between neighbourhoods in Oslo.

AB  - Decomposition of an urban space into a set of relatively morphologically homogeneous entities, or urban structural units (USUs), offers a new descriptive perspective from which explanatory and interpretive insights may be derived to support urban planning and design. The USU is defined in terms of its component elements and their relationships, consistent with an integrated urban form classification framework intended to facilitate investigation (and potentially, intervention) across multiple scales. The present research illustrates the application of this framework through the disaggregation of a morphologically diverse suburban area – the municipality of Randwick in Sydney, Australia – into its constituent USUs, based on local configurations of built form, open space, vegetation structure and street pattern. The utility of the USU method is discussed with reference to the post-carbon city, addressing urban metabolism (material and energy flows) and urban microclimate. The Randwick USU plan is compared with the municipal land use plan, and differences are examined in the context of changes in use over time. A significant source of these discrepancies appears to be the adaptive reuse of existing buildings to support new functions, which not only preserves heritage building stock but reduces resource consumption and carbon emissions from new construction. The paper concludes that the structural description of an area through its USU plan complements the functional description given by a conventional land use plan, facilitating a variety of assessment methods which can provide data necessary for the planning, design and management of the post-carbon city.

AB  - Neuroeconomics is a new area of research in the behavioral sciences which seeks to elucidate the biological underpinnings of economic and social decision making. One of the first major accomplishments of this highly interdisciplinary field is the reevaluation of classical theories of economic decision making by showing that the inclusion of biological and psychological variables adds much explanatory power to these models. Most recently, scholars in the field have also started to focus on individual differences and stable behavioral variability to improve these models even more. In this symposium, five papers will be presented that combine a wide range of different neuroscientific techniques (molecular genetics, structural magnetic resonance imaging and functional imaging of the behaving and resting brain) with experimental and survey-based behavioral methods to study individual differences in economic (loss aversion, risk aversion, self-control) and social decision making (altruism, pro-social behavior).

This study adds to the literature by (i) investigating the relationship between neighbourhood quality and child health, (ii) by utilizing subjective assessments by individuals familiar with the neighbourhood (i.e., the survey respondent and interviewer), and (iii) by utilizing multiple assessments of neighbourhood quality, and (iv) by investigating several measures of health. Other work has found that controlling for family level characteristics reduces or eliminates the apparent association between neighbourhood quality and health. We find, measuring both child well-being and neighbourhood quality multi-dimensionally, that even after controlling for family level characteristics neighbourhood quality has strong associations with child well-being.

AB  - We investigated the relationship between perceptions of neighbourhood quality and self-rated health for residents of eight suburban neighbourhoods with modestly contrasting income profiles in the Vancouver Census Metropolitan Area. Survey respondents from lower income neighbourhoods more often rated their health as fair/poor, and perceived their neighbourhood to be of poor quality. The strongest predictors for fair/poor health status were employment status, body mass index, neighbourhood satisfaction, and age, while modest predictors were annual household income, neighbourhood median income profile, and perceptions of neighbourhood safety. The unique contribution of this study is its demonstration that social gradients in self-rated health are observable between neighbourhoods of even modestly contrasting income profiles. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With more than half of the world’s population living in urban areas and climate change, one of the biggest challenges of our times, it is time to turn our attention to cities in order to tackle this challenge. The layout or urban form of a city can influence the environmental impact of the urban settlement to a considerable extent. There are great differences between cities in terms of their urban form and their environmental footprints. Five key elements of urban form can be distin- guished: density, surface, land use, road/public transport infrastructure and the eco- nomic relationship with the surrounding environment. The compact city is often advocated as a more sustainable urban form but this is not undisputed. Urban form can influence the environmental impact, but it can only facilitate; it is people and their behaviour that ultimately determine the negative or positive environmental impact of urban areas.

AB  - Summary.  Neighbourhood characteristics affect the social and economic opportunities of their residents. Although various studies have analysed housing adjustments at different life stages, little is known about neighbourhood quality adjustments, or movements into ‘better’ or ‘worse’ neighbourhoods. On the basis of a model of optimal housing consumption we analyse the determinants of residential mobility and the associated neighbourhood quality adjustments, drawing on data from the British Household Panel Survey and indices of multiple deprivation. We measure quality of neighbourhood both subjectively and objectively and find that not all life course events that are associated with moves lead to neighbourhood quality adjustments. Single people are negatively affected when ceasing to live with parents and couples by a husband's unemployment. Couples having a new baby move into better neighbourhoods.

AB  - Summary.  Neighbourhood characteristics affect the social and economic opportunities of their residents. Although various studies have analysed housing adjustments at different life stages, little is known about neighbourhood quality adjustments, or movements into ‘better’ or ‘worse’ neighbourhoods. On the basis of a model of optimal housing consumption we analyse the determinants of residential mobility and the associated neighbourhood quality adjustments, drawing on data from the British Household Panel Survey and indices of multiple deprivation. We measure quality of neighbourhood both subjectively and objectively and find that not all life course events that are associated with moves lead to neighbourhood quality adjustments. Single people are negatively affected when ceasing to live with parents and couples by a husband's unemployment. Couples having a new baby move into better neighbourhoods.

AB  - xcitation transfer refers to the main effect of an arousing experience (e.g. exercise) on subsequent emotional reactions (e.g. reactions to emotional photographs). Residual arousal from the earlier task is said to “transfer” to the latter task, with the arousal being misattributed to subsequent stimuli. Studies examining individual differences in excitation transfer have focused on physical charac- teristics, such as cardiovascular fitness. However, because excitation transfer involves both arousal and hedonic tone, it may be that personality dimensions relevant to arousability or emotional reactivity may predict individual differences in the excitation transfer effect. Several hypotheses were proposed based upon differing personality theories. Results supported the notion that excitation transfer is strongest for the hedonically-valenced emotions with which the person has relatively less experience. Extraversion predicted excitation transfer to unpleasant (but not pleasant) stimuli, and Neuroticism predicted excitation transfer to pleasant (but not unpleasant) stimuli. Results are discussed in terms of processing bodily information more during unfamiliar than familiar affective states.

AB  - This study consists of a contextual analysis of a group of Central Anatolian Neolithic settlements that includes the sites of Aşıklı Höyük, Canhasan III, Çatalhöyük,Erbaba, and Canhasan I, and can be dated between 8500 and 5500 Calibrated BC. These settlements are characterised by a spatial organisation in which buildings are grouped in neighbourhood clusters and in which an estimated 30 to 40 households would have lived. These neighbourhoods lack streets, and the buildings within them were accessed from the roof level. The study explores the social significance of this form of organisation of settlement space at a number of levels. First, the nature of the individual buildings and how these related to household is investigated. Second, non-domestic features in these settlements, such as sub-floor burials, are contextualised in order to identify status differentiation between buildings. Third, the scale and composition of clustered neighbourhoods is studied, to arrive at a better understanding of their significance. Finally, the manner in which neighbourhoods in a settlement related to one another and the ways in which settlements were part of larger settlement systems is considered. In this manner new light is shed on the social structure of these Central Anatolian Neolithic communities

AB  - Geographical variations in voluntary sector activity are important where they lead to inequity in service provision and differences in the opportunity to participate in voluntary group activities. However, despite important theoretical work, very little work has demonstrated variation empirically, particularly variation at the local (neighbourhood) level. This paper, for the first time, examines nationally representative data to illustrate the very real geographical differences across England in the prevalence of voluntary organisations working at a neighbourhood scale. Overall, less deprived local areas have a much higher prevalence than more deprived local areas. While certain kinds of organisations are more prevalent in more deprived areas, including those working in the field of economic well-being, this reflects the presence of organisations which receive public funds. These patterns are consistent with a key element of 'voluntary sector failure', resource insufficiency, and the important role of government in ensuring resources are available in areas of particular need. © 2012 Pion and its Licensors.

AB  - This study focuses on the developing urban morphology of Lexington, Kentucky since about 1790, in order to demonstrate how inherited urban geographies help shape racial patterns in the American city. The empirical component begins with a contemporary (potential) racial flashpoint as a catalyst for unpacking the city’s urban morphological transformations since the late 18th century. The Lexington case illustrates the importance of particular understandings of urban sociospatial form as key in shaping racialized landscapes in general. It also contributes to a richer understanding of Southern city form and development, and ultimately holds forth the possibilities for intervening in urban sociospatial processes through the cultural landscape to chal- lenge the always-reformulating processes of racial formation.

A rathervague value that is warmly endorsed by nearly everyone, livability is rarely defined in operationalterms. What is a livable city? The concept of livability is complex and encompasses many aspects ofurban life, including social and economic factors, but several dimensions of the built environment areimportant as well. Planners and urban designers must go beyond conventional measures such asland-use patterns, residential density, floor area ratio (FAR), or automobile circulation, which havelimited proven value in measuring or predicting the quality of the built environment as experienced byits users. Morphological studies of these new “livability” dimensions will be essential to managing theexperiential quality of the built environment.

AB  - Eggert contrasts the political implications of Nietzsche's and Adler's concepts of the will to power. To the former it was an overflow of life, strength, and cosmic power. He was the bitterest enemy of democracy, socialism, communism, and Judaism, the inner unity of which he was the first to perceive and unmask. Adler, however, recognized no distinction between neurotic and political will to power, and he made the idea a world philosophy. With liberalistic nonpolitical methods, he prepared the way for collectivism, pacifism, and Marxism. "Social progress," "a peaceful realm for all peoples," complete socialization of all men, a classless society in which no man has power over others, and absence of the principle of leadership-these contradict the system of nature and human values. Race is of higher value than humanity and equality. Individual psychology is the devaluation of reality through the ideal, and of the present in favor of the future. It has secretly twisted Nietzsche's fundamental idea into a contrary meaning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper investigates how adolescents react to living in urban areas of concentrated poverty, and whether contextual effects on psychological strain and delinquent behaviour exist, using a cross-sectional youth survey in 61 neighbourhoods in two German cities and a rural area (n = ca. 5300). Multi-level analysis is applied to estimate neighbourhood effects controlling for individual socio-demographic composition. Results suggest that neighbourhood effects on delinquency exist which are, however, dependent on the spatial orientation of adolescents’ routine activities and peer networks. Adolescents with an immigrant background do not seem to be influenced by neighbourhood conditions in the same way that native adolescents are. In particular, native girls react to neighbourhood disadvantage by resorting to violence. A tentative cross-classified multi-level model suggests that schools and neighbourhood contexts simultaneously affect adolescents’ delinquency.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the degree of ethnic residential segregation and diversification in Dutch neighbourhoods. Design/methodology/approach - Using data on neighbourhood level, the authors calculate segregation and diversification indices, and illustrate the distribution of main origin groups by cumulative distribution functions. A preliminary analysis is conducted to quantify the relationship between neighbourhood ethnic composition and economic outcomes (income and welfare dependency). Findings - No evidence is found on the existence of mono-ethnic neighbourhoods in The Netherlands. The higher concentration of non-Western immigrants in the large cities occurs in neighbourhoods with a high degree of diversity from several origins. An apparent strong correlation between the concentration of non-Western immigrants and the prevalence of social benefits is likely due to the composition effect. The findings counter the public opinion that ghetto-like neighbourhoods are dominant. They suggest that neighbourhood housing composition plays possibly an important role to attract immigrants with a weak socio-economic position, who are often from a variety of non-Western countries, rather than from a single origin. Practical implications - Social policies aimed at improving neighbourhood quality affect non-Western immigrants from different source countries simultaneously, as they tend to live together in immigrant neighbourhoods. But integration policies targeted at neighbourhoods are insufficient, as many immigrants live in areas with low immigrant density: policies targeted at individuals (and families) remain indispensable. Originality/value - This is the first paper to document segregation and diversity in The Netherlands, using unique neighbourhood level data. Applying cumulative distribution functions to these issues is also novel.

AB  - This paper reviews studies which have dealt with the relationship between morningness-eveningness (circadian typology) and other individual differences such as age, sex, personality dimensions and work schedule of their subjects. It appeared that the changes in the morningness-eveningness preference covaried with the age related changes in the internal body clock. An older age was associated with morningness while younger subjects tended towards eveningness, the critical age for the circadian typology change was 50 years. Sex-related differences are too small to be reflected in the scores on circadian typology questionnaires, although women were ahead of men by 1 hr in their circadian rhythms. The results on work schedule proved its role as a synchronizer modifying the morningness factor. The morningness dimension and extraversion are probably related through the impulsivity subdimension, which is closely associated with brain activation. Further research is needed to clarify the relationship between morningness and other personality dimensions (neuroticism, psychoticism), because the results are inconclusive. The influence of circadian typology on the tolerance to shift work and life habits are also discussed. The results with regard to shift work revealed the importance of morningness in determining human tolerance and health complaints. As regards life habits, there were differences in various aspects related to circadian typology especially psychoactive substances consumption

AB  - Describes similarities and differences between existential psychology (EP) and individual psychology (IP). Both contend that life is strenuous and that decisions create meaning; both explain present functioning in terms of the future, emphasize developmental change throughout life, stress the importance of consciousness, and are more humanistically than behaviorally oriented. However, basic differences also exist. Two in particular seem fundamental: (1) EP emphasizes the role of personal choice more than does IP. In the latter, all persons are believed to experience some sense of inferiority, which is the basis for compensatory effort. In EP, feeling inferior indicates a decision that has been made; and the essence of human nature is the decision-making capability. (2) In IP, the goals of the life plan are conventional and socially valued, seen as compensating for universally felt inferiorities. In EP the "fundamental project" considered developmentally desirable would be generic rather than concrete, individualistic rather than social. Thus EP emerges as placing more value on behavioral variability, while IP values behavioral stability more highly. (10 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved).

AB  - Accessibility is a comprehensive performance measure for the integration between land use and transport systems. In this research, two accessibility measures were applied to evaluate the integration between transport and land use in Hanoi metropolitan area: Vietnam, which has a typical monocentric urban form in the current situation, and Randstad metropolitan area, the Netherlands, which has a typical polycentric urban form. Job accessibility by private and public transport was calculated using the traditional potential accessibility measure corrected for competition of jobs. The results show there is a potential improvement of levels of accessibility in Hanoi through its planned transition into a polycentric urban form. The results illustrate the complex relationship between urban and regional planning and transport, and how spatial knowledge and geographic information system (GIS) tools can be used to provide urban planners, transport planners and engineers in Hanoi with valuable information related to its present plans of decentralization, and bring them together.

AB  - This paper provides an empirical analysis of the multidimensional, spatio-temporal quality of life (QoL) trends followed by neighbourhoods in Charlotte, NC, between 2000 and 2010. Employing a combined geocomputational and visual technique based on the self-organising map, the study addresses which types of neighbourhood experienced the most change or stability, where (in attribute and geographical spaces) did neighbourhoods that began the decade with a particular set of character- istics evolve to, and where did neighbourhoods that concluded the decade transition from? Results indicate that the highest QoL neighbourhoods were most stable, while those with lower homeownership, closer to the city centre, exhibited the sharpest longitudinal trajectories. Lower-income neighbourhoods are found to be heteroge- neous in terms of their social problems, dividing between high crime concentrations and youth-related social problems. An exchange of these social issues over time is observed as well as geographic spread of crime to middle-ring suburbs.

Odd-even reliability of monitoring accuracy was not significantly different from zero; students with at least 20 correct and 20 incorrect answers had higher reliability when the odd and even subsets of questions were matched on recall accuracy. The best reliability was observed when the distribution of confidence ratings was equated across odd and even question subsets, and students had at least 20 confidence judgments at each level. In Study 2, a 100-item mutiple-choice general knowledge test led to odd-even reliability for confidence-recognition accuracy that was fairly high, relative to previous research, but well below desired levels. For FOK-recognition, odd-even reliability was significantly different from zero, but low. These data indicate that current methods allow an individuals' monitoring accuracy to be assessed with low to moderate reliability. Suggestions for further research are offered.

Loehlin launches the reader on a fascinating journey through data on twins, adoptions, and other family relationships to discover how genes and environment act jointly to create temperament and personality differences in individuals. Beginning with a careful introduction to model-fitting methods that are increasingly used to summarize findings and make inferences in human behavior genetics, Loehlin examines the relative contributions of genes and environment to such topics as: the "Big Five" dimensions of personality, personality change over time, and how the genotype-environment findings for personality compare with neighboring trait domains such as ability. The book concludes with a look at how the research results on individual personality variation relate to evolutionary views about human nature. ((c) 1997 APA/PsycINFO, all rights reserved).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of visual impairment due to either underlying ocular pathology or easily correctable refractive error on vision-related functioning and quality of life (QOL) in Vancouver's downtown eastside (VDES). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred consecutive patients seeking general medical care at the Vancouver Native Health Society (VNHS) medical clinic were included. METHODS: An ocular examination was performed and a standardized history and QOL information were obtained for each participant. Effective visual impairment was classified based on patients' current refractive means. Pathological visual impairment was classified based on patients' best-corrected visual acuity (VA). Vision-related functioning was quantified using the Daily Tasks Dependent on Vision (DTDV) questionnaire. Health-related QOL was assessed using the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). RESULTS: Two hundred patients participated; they suffered, on average, 6.2 comorbid conditions. Sixty-two patients (31%) were effectively visually impaired and, of these, 14 patients (7%) were effectively blind. Ten patients (5%) had pathological eye disease to explain their visual impairment. The remaining 52 visually impaired patients (26%) had VA that normalized with correction. Difficulty with the tasks described in the DTDV questions was significantly correlated with effective visual impairment. Patients with effective visual impairment had lower Physical Composite Scores on the SF-12 in multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated a very high rate of visual impairment in a low socioeconomic population that is associated with decreased vision-dependent functioning and decreased overall physical health status. Public health efforts need to be directed toward improving easily correctable refractive error.

AB  - The recent surge of poverty in the industrial nations seems to be accompanied by increasing concentration of the poor in urban space. As a problem distinct from poverty, the spatial concentration of poverty, reflected in the rising number of poor neighbourhoods, has some serious social consequences of its own ranging from concentrating problems such as crime, school drop-out, and teen-pregnancy in few neighbourhoods, and the development of a sub-culture distinct from mainstream culture. Despite its seriousness, however, neighbourhood poverty has not received much attention in Canada. Addressing this gap in the literature, the present article examines the magnitude of the problem in Canada and its changes between 1986 and 1996. The findings of the study clearly indicate that the urban areas in Quebec and the Prairie, Montreal and Winnipeg in particular, are most severely hit by the rise of neighbourhood poverty. Other cities in these areas, along with Toronto, Kingston, Halifax, and St. John's have begun to experience an alarming rise only between 1991 and 1996. Smaller cities in Ontario, along with Victoria in B.C., are the only ones that have witnessed a decline in their neighbourhood poverty rates. The regional variations in the magnitude of the neighbourhood poverty in Canada may indicate, among others, that the economic recessions of the mid-80s and early-90s have affected certain areas more severely than others.

This paper offers a preliminary economic analysis of Australian neighbourhood externalities in the context of increasing segmentation. Theoretically, neighbourhoods can affect youths' economic outcomes through their effects on school quality, information flows, job networks, and demonstration effects. We utilise a new survey of 171 year 12 students in ten Melbourne high schools to examine the impact of individual, family, and neighbourhood characteristics on the decision to attend post-secondary education. It is shown that there exist neighbourhood externalities that affect human capital investment decisions. Finally, we offer some tentative implications for public policy.

AB  - This largely methodological paper focuses on how to define the social economy and its governance at the local and especially the urban neighbourhood level. A distinction is made between essentialist and holistic definitions. The second section appraises the potential contribution of various current ideas in institutional economics and economic sociology to the definition of the social economy and its governance. It is found that 'old' and 'new' institutionalism in particular offer useful tools, including the holistic methodology as applied by John Commons. The third section elaborates on the analytical elements required for defining the social economy from a holistic perspective, stressing the role of essentialist abstract categories, the role of local culture and articulation between spatial scales. First, we show how the notion of social capital defined through a 'holistic approach' can enrich the definition of the social economy. Secondly, we stress the importance of empirical investigations in feeding into the holistic definitional work. The fourth section concludes the paper by enhancing the necessary dialogue between an abstract-essentialist and a contextualised holistic definition of the social economy at the neighbourhood level.

The primary objectives were: (1) to evaluate the influence of student characteristics and public high school social climate on adolescent global self-esteem in a first-stage or micro-model; (2) to evaluate the influence of social climate on the variability of individual differences from school to school in a second-stage or macro-model; and (3) to cross-validate the first- and second-stage models to assess generalizability of the findings. Schools (n = 219) and students (n = 13022) were sampled from High School and Beyond, a database representative of secondary schools and students in the U.S.A.; half the sample was set aside for cross-validation purposes. Collective well-being and distress were predictors of adolescent esteem in the presence of theoretically important student characteristics. The relationship of social climate to variability of esteem suggests that a positive climate may reduce individual differences within the school. Methodological comments on the employed multilevel analysis are offered. �� 1994

AB  - Behavioral decision-making as measured with a gambling task has been found to be impaired in several pathological conditions such as brain lesions, addiction, and personality disorders. It is not known how individual differences influence performance on behavioral decision-making. The goal of the present study was to examine to what extent performance on behavioral measures of decision-making is predicted by self-reported personality traits of sensitivity for punishment and reward, impulsivity, and decision-making styles. For this goal, performance on the IOWA gambling task was related to the BIS/BAS questionnaire, the Dickman Impulsivity Inventory, and the Adolescent Decision Making Questionnaire in a sample of students (n = 44). The results showed that behavioral decision-making was to some extent predicted by individual differences in sensitivity for reward and self-reported decision-making style. However, behavioral decision-making was not predicted by impulsive personality traits. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Specifically, empirical evidence of linkages between three personality dimensions-psychoticism, extraversion, and neuroticism-and five television viewing motives-Pass Time, Companionship, Relaxation, Information, and Stimulation-is detailed. The findings, based on a sample of undergraduates (612 males; 526 females), revealed that individuals in the neuroticism personality dimension, compared to those in the psychoticism and extraversion groups, strongly endorsed the Pass Time, Companionship, Relaxation, and Stimulation motives for television viewing. Further, the data show that individuals in the socially outgoing extraversion group strongly reject the notion of using television as a functional alternative to interpersonal companionship. Some implications of these findings are discussed. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation between neighbourhood socioeconomic and ethnic characteristics with depressive symptoms in a population based sample. DESIGN: Cross sectional data from the CARDIA study, including the Center for Epidemiological Studies depression scale score (CES-D). Neighbourhoods were 1990 US census blocks of 1000 people; six census variables reflecting wealth/income, education, and occupation investigated separately and as a summary score; neighbourhood racial composition (percentage white and black) and individual level income and education were also examined. SETTING: Participants recruited in 1985/86 from community lists in Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis MN; from a health plan in Oakland, CA. PARTICIPANTS: 3437 adults aged 28-40 years in 1995/96: 24% white men, 27% white women, 20% black men, 29% black women. MAIN RESULTS: For each race-sex group, CES-D was inversely related to neighbourhood score and individual income and education. Associations of neighbourhood score with CES-D became weak and inconsistent after adjusting for individual level factors; personal income remained strongly and inversely associated with CES-D. Age adjusted mean differences (standard errors) in CES-D between the lowest and highest income categories were 3.41 (0.62) for white men, 4.57 (0.64) for white women, 5.80 (0.87) for black men, and 5.74 (0.83) for black women. For both black and white participants, CES-D was associated negatively with percentage of white people and positively with percentage of black people in their census block, before, but not after, adjustment for individual and neighbourhood socioeconomic variables. CONCLUSIONS: Neither neighbourhood socioeconomic characteristics nor ethnic density were consistently related to depressive symptoms once individual socioeconomic characteristics were taken into account.

AB  - Investigated relations between 3 measures of individual differences (Neuroticism, Type A/B personality, and Locus of Control) and measures of stress in response to the challenge of performing mental arithmetic. 34 Ss (aged 25â€“61 yrs) participated. Three types of dependent measure were recorded: self-report (stress and arousal), psychophysiological (heart rate and skin resistance), and performance (number of problems attempted and proportion correct). Relations between the individual difference measures (and their interactions) and the stress and performance measures were assessed by multiple regression. Results show that different types of response to stress are related to individual differences in complex patterns, and several independent and dependent measures are needed to provide a comprehensive picture.

AB  - Methods that leverage neighbourhood structures in high-dimensional image spaces have recently attracted attention. These approaches extract information from a new image using its "neighbours" in the image space equipped with an application-specific distance. Finding the neighbourhood of a given image is challenging due to large dataset sizes and costly distance evaluations. Furthermore, automatic neighbourhood search for a new image is currently not possible when the distance is based on ground truth annotations. In this article we present a general and efficient solution to these problems. "neighbourhood approximation forests" (NAF) is a supervised learning algorithm that approximates the neighbourhood structure resulting from an arbitrary distance. As NAF uses only image intensities to infer neighbours it can also be applied to distances based on ground truth annotations. We demonstrate NAF in two scenarios: (i) choosing neighbours with respect to a deformation-based distance, and (ii) age prediction from brain MRI. The experiments show NAF's approximation quality, computational advantages and use in different contexts.

AB  - Two studies were undertaken to investigate the development of skill in mental addition. In Study 1, a sample of 123 second-, fourth-, and sixthgraders were administered 140 simple addition problems in a true-false reaction time (RT) format; scores on eight subtests of the Stanford Achievement Test were also available on these subjects. In Study 2, the sample consisted of 63 second-, fourth-, and sixth-graders and 100 college students. The RT tasks used in Study 2 comprised 80 simple addition problems and 80 complex addition problems, and a set of six paper-and-pencil tests for Numerical Facility and Perceptual Speed was also administered to the subjects. The results of the two studies support several conclusions. First, there are substantial individual differences in the age at which the transition from counting to retrieval strategies occurs. A large proportion of students in second grade already rely primarily on retrieval to respond to addition problems, yet a sizeable minority of sixth graders and even college students still apparently rely heavily on counting processes to solve addition problems. Second, there are different rates of automatization for the several processes that underlie skill in mental addition, processes of encoding of digits, recomputing or retrieving the correct sum, and carrying to the next column. Third, individual differences in efficiency in mental addition, indexed by retrieval speed for retrieval subjects and incrementing speed for digital subjects, exhibited strong relationships with achievement and ability measures. The results of these two studies demonstrated (a) the internal and external validity of the component processes in the proposed model of mental addition performance and (b) the need to use individual-level data to characterize properly the development of the cognitive skills underlying mental addition.

AB  - Significant attention has been given in urban policy literature to the integration of land-use and transport planning and policies—with a view to curbing sprawling urban form and diminishing externalities associated with car-dependent travel patterns. By taking land-use and transport interaction into account, this debate mainly focuses on how a successful integration can contribute to societal well-being, providing efficient and balanced economic growth while accomplishing the goal of developing sustainable urban environments and communities. The integration is also a focal theme of contemporary urban development models, such as smart growth, liveable neighbourhoods, and new urbanism. Even though available planning policy options for ameliorating urban form and transport-related externalities have matured—owing to growing research and practice worldwide—there remains a lack of suitable evaluation models to reflect on the current status of urban form and travel problems or on the success of implemented integration policies. In this study we explore the applicability of indicator-based spatial indexing to assess land-use and transport integration at the neighbourhood level. For this, a spatial index is developed by a number of indicators compiled from international studies and trialled in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. The results of this modelling study reveal that it is possible to propose an effective metric to determine the success level of city plans considering their sustainability performance via composite indicator methodology. The model proved useful in demarcating areas where planning intervention is applicable, and in identifying the most suitable locations for future urban development and plan amendments. Lastly, we integrate variance-based sensitivity analysis with the spatial indexing method, and discuss the applicability of the model in other urban contexts.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation between neighbourhood socioeconomic and ethnic characteristics with depressive symptoms in a population based sample. DESIGN: Cross sectional data from the CARDIA study, including the Center for Epidemiological Studies depression scale score (CES-D). Neighbourhoods were 1990 US census blocks of 1000 people; six census variables reflecting wealth/income, education, and occupation investigated separately and as a summary score; neighbourhood racial composition (percentage white and black) and individual level income and education were also examined. SETTING: Participants recruited in 1985/86 from community lists in Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis MN; from a health plan in Oakland, CA. PARTICIPANTS: 3437 adults aged 28-40 years in 1995/96: 24% white men, 27% white women, 20% black men, 29% black women. MAIN RESULTS: For each race-sex group, CES-D was inversely related to neighbourhood score and individual income and education. Associations of neighbourhood score with CES-D became weak and inconsistent after adjusting for individual level factors; personal income remained strongly and inversely associated with CES-D. Age adjusted mean differences (standard errors) in CES-D between the lowest and highest income categories were 3.41 (0.62) for white men, 4.57 (0.64) for white women, 5.80 (0.87) for black men, and 5.74 (0.83) for black women. For both black and white participants, CES-D was associated negatively with percentage of white people and positively with percentage of black people in their census block, before, but not after, adjustment for individual and neighbourhood socioeconomic variables. CONCLUSIONS: Neither neighbourhood socioeconomic characteristics nor ethnic density were consistently related to depressive symptoms once individual socioeconomic characteristics were taken into account.

AB  - City Rules offers a challenge to students and professionals in urban planning, design, and policy to change the rules of city-building, using regulations to reinvigorate, rather than stifle, our communities. Emily Talen demonstrates that regulations are a primary detriment to the creation of a desirable urban form. While many contemporary codes encourage sprawl and even urban blight, that hasn't always been the case-and it shouldn't be in the future. Talen provides a visually rich history, showing how certain eras used rules to produce beautiful, walkable, and sustainable communities, while others created just the opposite. She makes complex regulations understandable, demystifying city rules like zoning and illustrating how written codes translate into real-world consequences. Most importantly, Talen proposes changes to these rules that will actually enhance communities' freedom to develop unique spaces.

AB  - This paper examines perceptions of quality of life in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada from the perspective of residents and key community stakeholders. A series of eight focus groups were conducted. Six sessions were held with residents of neighbourhood ‘‘hubs’’, areas characterized by high levels of poverty. The following themes were high- lighted as significant to neighbourhood quality of life: (1) housing quality and affordability (2) diversity and cultural integration; (3) crime and safety; (4) community engagement and recreation; (5) green space and the physical environment, and; (6) transportation. Two focus groups were then conducted with key informants who provided recommendations for improving quality of life and discussed relevant policy issues such as employment and income security. The findings of the focus groups resonate with local research and policy action in Hamilton, including a new Neighbourhood Development Strategy for the City. This research advocates for decision-makers to support and work alongside context-based, resident-led community development efforts. The hub model, as well as Hamilton’s broader neighbourhood-based research and community development approach may assist social researchers, civic leaders and various levels of government across Canada as they work to improve quality of life in their communities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purposes of this study are to determine (i) if neighbourhood socioeconomic status (SES) is systematically related to the prevalence of overweight children and youth in Canada, (ii) if the factors accounting for the apparent relationship have face validity, and (iii) if neighbourhood SES has an independent influence on this distribution. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from Cycle 4 (2000/2001) of the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth were used. Children and youth aged 5 to 17 were included. Overweight was established using age and sex cut-off points. Neighbourhood socioeconomic data were obtained from the Statistics Canada 2001 Dissemination Area databases and SES quartiles constructed using a composite of socio-economic variables. Hierarchical non-linear modelling was used to test for independent neighbourhood effects. RESULTS: A gradient of increasing overweight prevalence by decreasing neighbourhood SES quartiles was observed (24% high SES, 30% mid-high SES, 33% mid-low SES, 35% low SES). Controlling for individual age, gender, family income and education hierarchical analysis found that a child's odds of being overweight increases if living in a low versus a high SES neighbourhood (OR=1.29, 95% CI=1.14-1.46). INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of child and youth overweight in Canada is inversely and statistically significantly related to neighbourhood SES. Independent effects indicate that neighbourhood characteristics directly influence the odds of being overweight. This research suggests that consideration of opportunity structures that exist in different types of neighbourhoods is fundamentally important to health promotion and disease prevention strategies.

AB  - Abstract: Whereas a variety of research has investigated how individual differences moderate attitude change (persuasion) processes, there is a relative dearth of research investigating how such individual differences moderate behavior change (compliance) processes. The current research assessed the extent to which two well-studied personality traits predicted susceptibility to the mindlessness technique (Langer, Blank, & Chanowitz, 1978). After completing need for cognition and self-monitoring scales, participants were asked to make photocopies for the experimenter. At the copy machine, a confederate asked to cut in line, providing no reason, a real reason, or a placebic reason. Results replicated those of Langer et al. (1978): The placebic reason elicited as much compliance as the real reason. Need for cognition did not moderate compliance, and participants high in self-monitoring were less likely to comply across conditions. In addition, participants who refused the request took significantly longer to respond than participants who complied. Our research therefore provides insight into a largely neglected field of study: How and when individual differences moderate behavior change processes. [Copyright 2009 Elsevier]

AB  - Individual differences in the effects of pharmacological and behavioral manipulations on slow cortical potentials (SCP) may reflect personality differences in type of informational control under attentional stress. Two experiments examined SCP component differences in 24 introverts and 24 extraverts (selected from the general population on the basis of Eysenck Personality Questionnaire scores) under different attentional tasks and with and without nicotine smoking stressor. In Exp I, a decrease in late negativity for introverts and an increase in late negativity for extraverts suggested that smoking enhanced introverts' stimulus set and extraverts' motor set. In Exp II, personality differences in SCP were examined within a signal-detection paradigm that allowed separate assessment of the contribution of sensory sensitivity and response bias factors to performance. Smoking increased sensitivity in both personality groups, but response bias (caution) increased in introverts only. Extraverts showed an increase in central negativity during smoking while introverts showed a decrease in negativity and a decrease in positive wave components. Results are explained in terms of a motor model of attentional control whereby smoking regulates inhibitory controlled actions in introverts but activates general motor processes for extraverts.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Associations were examined between neighbourhood income inequality and neighbourhood socioeconomic deprivation on the one hand and (mental) health related quality of life (QoL) on the other, in Maastricht, the Netherlands. METHODS: Three different data sources were used: 1) neighbourhood socioeconomic indicators, 2) house prices per postal code area aggregated to an inequality measure at neighbourhood level, and 3) individual data measured in a family cohort study. Maastricht families with children aged approximately 11 years received questionnaires including the parents' QoL and family socioeconomic status (response rate: 60%). Multilevel analyses were conducted using neighbourhood level, family level, and individual level data. RESULTS: Income inequality at neighbourhood level was not associated with QoL, whereas socioeconomic deprivation was associated with environment-related QoL. CONCLUSION: The relative income hypothesis, according to which it is the contrast in deprivation rather than the absolute level of deprivation that influences health outcomes, does not hold at the neighbourhood level. Income inequality may only have an effect in larger areas containing sufficient socioeconomic contrast.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effects of family and place on health outcomes may be seriously misestimated by standard analytic techniques. The information-rich settings in several Canadian provinces can provide appropriate designs to minimize biases resulting from omitted variables and measurement error. This paper compares siblings with children living in the same neighbourhood (but not in the same family) in terms of health care utilization and health care costs. A complete history of residential mobility since birth permits an estimate of the effects of exposure to different environments. METHODS: Registry data from a Manitoba cohort born between 1978 and 1985 and continuously resident in the province generated a large sample of same-sex siblings and neighbours (N = 18,280). Administrative information on physician billings, hospital inpatient stays, and costs provided data on utilization between ages 12 and 17. RESULTS: Large effects on the outcome variables were associated with being in the same family (correlations up to 0.50), whereas the correlations representing upper limits on neighbourhood effects were usually small. These neighbourhood correlations typically shrank slightly after adjustment for family effects. Higher neighbour correlations with utilization (particularly ambulatory visits) occurred in rural Manitoba and probably reflect variation in access to care. Higher correlations are associated with relatively small neighbourhoods and with families remaining in the neighbourhood for at least 17 years. DISCUSSION: Although specific variables taken from administrative data are only marginally predictive, our results emphasize the importance of "family" in affecting health care utilization in Manitoba. The minimal effects of neighbourhood differ from those found by investigators generally using weaker designs and emphasizing the significance of neighbourhood.

AB  - The current study examined assertive behavior and its relationship to two personality variables—need for social approval (nApp) and the defense mechanism “Turning Against Objects” (TAO)—and one situational variable—the status of the target person. The subjects, 51 female and 41 male undergraduates participated in role play situations which differed with regard to the status (lower, equal and higher) of the target person. They also completed the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability scale and the Defense Mechanism Inventory (Glesser and Ihilevich, 1969). The results revealed a significant interaction between TAO, the approach component of nApp, and the status of the target person. The equal-status situation seemed to be differentiated from both unequal-status situations. The high-nApp- high-TAO subjects differed from all other groups in being less rather than more assertive towards peers than towards others. The patterns that emerged confirmed the interactional approach that both situational and dispositional factors contribute to determining assertiveness of behavior. Tentative interpretations of the findings were suggested with reference to social comparison theory, and implications for further research applications were discussed.

AB  - Citizen participation in neighbourhood development is one way to promote public health and contribute to the well-being of individuals. However, some people participate while others do not. This study examines the individual characteristics of people who during the past 2 years have participated in a neighbourhood development process compared with potential and non-participants. Socio-demographic factors, perceptions and behaviour were analysed in a cross-sectional study. A questionnaire was answered by 1160 randomly chosen citizens over the age of 18 who lived in three Swedish cities. The most important single factor related to participation in neighbourhood development was prior experience of participation, such as attempting to influence city policies by contacting politicians, submitting a citizen proposal, etc. Furthermore, having frequent political discussions with neighbours was another behavioural factor that was found associated to peoples participation in neighbourhood development. Among socio-demographic factors, only ethnicity was found significant after controlling for other factors; i.e. people born outside the Nordic countries were less likely to participate.

AB  - The articles in this issue are about the relationships of Individual Psychology: to people, to other theories, or to various areas of endeavor. The first article argues that environmental psychology, with its emphasis on crowding and a sense of place, has congruencies with Individual Psychology's formulation of environment as a place where one lives, concern for one's environment, and emphasis on social interest. The second author finds that positive psychology's constructive goals of involvement, encouragement, improvement, and accomplishment relate to Individual Psychology through the construct of social interest. The next article employs constructs in Adlerian theory, such as teleology and soft determinism, to help understand men's resistance to obtaining help. The next article reports on the early recollections of nine young people who met the diagnostic criteria for reactive attachment disorder. They found themes in the early recollections of self alone, of others as abandoning, and of events as unfair. The Articles section of this issue concludes with discussion of the task of work as described by Adler as "an integral part of the unity of the person." Implications of this are far reaching, including viewing work as a way for a person to contribute to the community and encouraging counselors to see work as an important topic in therapy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: To examine relationships between perceived neighbourhood cohesion and alcohol, tobacco and cannabis consumption in New Zealand.\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS: A two-level random intercept regression model was used to examine the extent to which perception of neighbourhood cohesion (at the individual and area level) was associated with the frequency of substance (alcohol, tobacco and cannabis) consumption, after controlling for demographics and deprivation. This study is based on data from two national Health Behaviours Surveys (Drugs and Alcohol) conducted in 2003 and 2004 in New Zealand. Data were collected by computer-assisted telephone interviewing with two complementary computer-assisted cellphone interviewing samples. The combined sample consists of 6346 men and 8411 women (n = 14,757) distributed across 1572 census area units.\n\nRESULTS: Perception of neighbourhood cohesion was significantly associated with the level of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis consumption. Individuals who perceived their neighbourhood as more cohesive had higher annual frequency of alcohol consumption but lower consumption on a typical drinking occasion. Higher perceived neighbourhood cohesion was also associated with a decrease in the probability of tobacco and cannabis use and of the amounts consumed. Area-level analysis suggested that aggregate census area unit-level neighbourhood cohesion exerted a significant additional contextual effect on the frequency of tobacco and cannabis consumption over and above individual perceptions of neighbourhood cohesiveness.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study provides empirical evidence that perceptions of the neighbourhood social environment are associated with people's substance consumption patterns. Increasing residents' sense of neighbourhood cohesion might prove a promising way to decrease health-damaging consumption behaviours.

It will argue that analysing the four-year old ENP presents a wide variety of challenges for scholars of the EU's relations with its near neighbours, in particular the question of theoretical presuppositions. The chapter will discuss these challenges in four parts involving the methodological location of ENP; the theoretical framing of ENP; a ‘normative power' approach to ENP; and concluding with a brief analytical reflection. The chapter also carries an argument - that the challenges of studying the ENP are least well served by traditional approaches to political science, and might be better advanced by rethinking these presumptions. Thus, conventional presumptions of ‘much ado about nothing' in ENP may benefit from a reflection on the extent to which these presumptions are determinate in analysing whether ENP is ‘as you like it'.

The article explores the implications of changes in the density of the project area over 34 years in the context of the growth and development of Dakar. It offers some unusual conclusions about how project design incorporates density in projects for low-income populations and how density itself changes over time as a result of project design. Specifically it argues that density was used as an absolute design parameter in the 1970s but has changed into a relational value or attribute which now explains in part why densities have increased fivefold.

AB  - Dutch urban renewal policies aim to engineer a mixture of different income groups in previously working-class neighbourhoods. The underlying notion is that such a social mix will improve the ‘liveability’ of the neighbourhood and that the more affluent residents will prevent the poorest from falling into a culture of poverty. As a result of this policy, the composition of the population in such neighbourhoods has changed and one can distinguish between the so-called native Dutch, immigrants, and ‘newcomers,’ who face problems in living together and sharing public spaces. This paper discusses the dynamics between the different groups in a Dutch neighbourhood, including its norms and values, and the role of intervening agencies.

AB  - While there is now considerable evidence that the neighbourhood income levels (poverty/affluence) exert an independent effect on health, there is little evidence that neighbourhood income inequality is consequential, net of individual-level socio-economic resources. We show that the usual explanation for the absence of an independent effect of neighbourhood inequality - the assumption of economic homogeneity at the neighbourhood level - cannot account for this result. The authors use hierarchical models that combine individual micro-data from Statistics Canada's 1996/97 National Population Health Survey (NPHS) with neighbourhood and city-level socio-economic characteristics from the 1996 Census of Canada to estimate the effects of neighbourhood affluence and income inequality on self-reported health status. The findings indicate that the negative "ecological" correlation between average neighbourhood health and neighbourhood income inequality is the result not only of compositional differences among individuals but also of contextual neighbourhood effects associated with low and high inequality neighbourhoods. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Social capital is said to influence health, mostly in research undertaken in high income countries' settings. Because social capital may differ from one setting to another, it is suggested that its measurement be context specific. We examine the association of individual and neighbourhood level social capital, and neighbourhood deprivation to self-rated health using a multi-level analysis.\n\nMETHODS: Data are taken from the 2008 South Africa National Income Dynamic Survey. Health was self-reported on a scale from 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). Two measures of social capital were used: individual, measured by two variables denoting trust and civic participation; and neighbourhood social capital, denoting support, association, behaviour and safety in a community.\n\nRESULTS: Compared to males, females were less likely to report good health (Odds Ratio 0.82: Confidence Interval 0.73, 0.91). There were variations in association of individual social capital and self-rated health among the provinces. In Western Cape (1.37: 0.98, 1.91) and North West (1.39: 1.13, 1.71), trust was positively associated with reporting good health, while the reverse was true in Limpopo (0.56: 0.38, 0.84) and Free State (0.70: 0.48, 1.02). In Western Cape (0.60: 0.44, 0.82) and Mpumalanga (0.72: 0.55, 0.94), neighbourhood social capital was negatively associated with reporting good health. In North West (1.59: 1.27, 1.99) and Gauteng (1.90: 1.21, 2.97), increased neighbourhood social capital was positively associated with reporting good health.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated the importance of considering contextual factors when analysing the relationship between social capital and health. Analysis by province showed variations in the way in which social capital affected health in different contexts. Further studies should be undertaken to understand the mechanisms through which social capital impacts on health in South Africa.

AB  - The relationship of individual differences, perceptions of lying in everyday life and perceptions of lying in a high stakes scenario (plagiarism at University) was investigated. It was expected that the personality constructs of Acting, Manipulativeness, Impression Management and Sociability would be positively related to a perceived ability to lie in everyday life and in a high stakes scenario, and that the construct of Anxiousness would be negatively related to the perceived ability to lie in everyday life and in a high stakes scenario. Undergraduate students (n = 265) were administered five personality construct measures, and a series of questions and statements concerning perceptions of lying in everyday life and in a high stake situation. In everyday life, there were significant findings for Acting and Manipulativeness in relation to perceptions of experiencing little guilt and mental effort whilst lying, experiencing duping delight, finding lying easy and that the lies are undetectable. Significant findings were also yielded for Anxiousness and Sociability, in relation to perceptions of feeling guilty and of manipulating others while lying. The hypotheses regarding Impression Management was rejected. In the high stake scenario there were significant findings for Manipulativeness in relation to the perceptions of feeling comfortable (before, during and after) the lie, being believed by the target of the lie and perceiving the situation better dealt with a lie rather than the truth, and Anxiousness in relation to planning the lie and being uncomfortable while lying. They hypotheses regarding Acting, Sociability and Impression Management were rejected. The implications for future research on individual differences and deceptive behaviour are discussed.

AB  - Citizen participation in neighbourhood development is one way to promote public health and contribute to the well-being of individuals. However, some people participate while others do not. This study examines the individual characteristics of people who during the past 2 years have participated in a neighbourhood development process compared with potential and non-participants. Socio-demographic factors, perceptions and behaviour were analysed in a cross-sectional study. A questionnaire was answered by 1160 randomly chosen citizens over the age of 18 who lived in three Swedish cities. The most important single factor related to participation in neighbourhood development was prior experience of participation, such as attempting to influence city policies by contacting politicians, submitting a citizen proposal, etc. Furthermore, having frequent political discussions with neighbours was another behavioural factor that was found associated to people's participation in neighbourhood development. Among socio-demographic factors, only ethnicity was found significant after controlling for other factors; i.e. people born outside the Nordic countries were less likely to participate.

AB  - Using data from selected areas in five UK cities, we studied the relationships between urban form and the following measures of ecosystem performance: availability and patch characteristics of tree cover, gardens and green space; storm-water run-off; maximum temperature; carbon sequestration. Although most measures of ecosystem performance declined with increasing urban density, there was considerable variability in the relationships. This suggests that at any given density, there is substantial scope for maximising ecological performance. The social status of residents was related to measures of tree cover. Housing type was significantly associated with some types of ecosystem service provision, indicating that the type of development may be important independent of its density. These findings have implications for understanding the distribution of ecosystem services and biodiversity across urban landscapes, and the management of development aimed at meeting UK government housing density targets. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper characterizes and reviews multidisciplinary approaches to urban form. It begins by classifying quantitative approaches to analyzing urban form into five classes: landscape ecology, economic structure, surface transportation, community design, and urban design. It then reviews quantitative measures in each class. Based on the review, four conclusions are drawn. First, over the last two decades substantial progress has been made in the ability to measure and analyze spatial patterns that help characterize urban form. Second, at multiples scales and for a variety of reasons, there are advantages to development that is mixed and compact. Third, normative principles and policies for addressing urban form need to be crafted at multiple scales and carefully designed to address the disparate issues that arise at each scale. Fourth, with so many disparate measures now used to operationalize the same constructs, it would advance urban form research to have some standardization in operational definitions and measurement protocols.

AB  - (from the chapter) There is now good evidence that area of residence predicts health and the ability to lead a healthy life, over and above individual characteristics such as social class and income (Riva et al. 2007), and attention is now increasingly focussed on understanding the mechanisms involved. It has been suggested that aspects of the local social and physical environment such as the availability of facilities to support day-to-day life may be important (Macintyre et al. 2002). In this chapter, we will explore how such facilities can be assessed and quantified for neighbourhood research by using the example of facilities and amenities relevant for physical activity. We will firstly give a brief overview of the existing literature on the importance of the neighbourhood built environment to obesity and then focus on the distribution of physical activity opportunities, drawing on a Scotland wide study. We will then explore the issue of access to physical activity opportunities using different forms of transport. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of schizophrenia varies by individual-level characteristics and neighbourhood-level attributes. Few specific socio-environmental risk factors (SERFs) have been identified at the neighbourhood level. Cross-level interactions are poorly understood. We investigated these issues using data from the Aetiology and Ethnicity in Schizophrenia and Other Psychoses (AESOP) study. METHOD: All incidence cases of ICD-10 schizophrenia (F20) and other non-affective psychoses (F21-29), aged 16-64 years, across 33 wards in Southeast London were identified over a 2-year period (1997-1999). Census data provided the denominator for each ward. Multilevel Poisson regression simultaneously modelled individual- and neighbourhood-level SERFs, including socio-economic deprivation, voter turnout (proxy for social capital), ethnic fragmentation (segregation) and ethnic density. RESULTS: A total of 218 subjects were identified during 565 576 person-years at risk. Twenty-three per cent of variance in incidence of schizophrenia across wards could be attributed to neighbourhood-level risk factors [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.9-42.2]. Thus, 1% increases in voter turnout [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.99] and ethnic segregation (IRR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.99) were both independently associated with a reduced incidence of 5%, independent of age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation and population density. This was similar for other non-affective psychoses. There was some evidence that ethnic minority individuals were at greater risk of schizophrenia in areas with smaller proportions of minority groups (p=0.07). CONCLUSION: SERFs at individual and neighbourhood levels were implicated in the aetiology of psychosis, but we were unable to determine whether these associations were causal. Individual risk may be mediated by social capital, which could operate as a protective factor, perhaps moderating social stress in the onset of psychoses.

AB  - At the basis of any emotional phenomenon lies core affect, defined as a simple, volatile feeling that is a blend of hedonic and arousal values. The present study was intended to increase our understanding of core affect reactivity by investigating within-person relationships between two daily event characteristics and core affect, and individual differences in such relationships. For 7 days, 73 participants described their core affect nine times each day. Simultaneously, they rated the impact and valence of the most significant event that had occurred since the previous measurement occasion. Multilevel analyses found that the perceived event characteristics under study were significantly related to both core affect dimensions. Furthermore, individual differences in extraversion and neuroticism played a significant role in core affect reactivity. The different patterns of results for these traits suggest that omnibus models explaining how traits per se interact with situational forces to influence behaviour may need to be revised. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neighbourhood differences in access to fresh fruit and vegetables may explain social inequalities in diet. Investigations have focused on variations in cost and availability as barriers to the purchase and consumption of fresh produce; investigations of quality have been neglected. Here we investigate whether produce quality systematically varies by food store type, rural-urban location and neighbourhood deprivation in a selection of communities across Scotland. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of twelve fresh fruit and vegetable items in 288 food stores in ten communities across Scotland. Communities were selected to reflect a range of urban-rural settings and a food retail census was conducted in each location. The quality of twelve fruit and vegetable items within each food store was evaluated. Data from the Scottish Executive were used to characterise each small area by deprivation and urban-rural classification. SETTING: Scotland. RESULTS: Quality of fruit and vegetables within the surveyed stores was high. Medium-sized stores, stores in small town and rural areas, and stores in more affluent areas tended to have the highest-quality fresh fruit and vegetables. Stores where food is secondary, stores in urban settings and stores in more deprived areas tended have the lowest-quality fresh produce. Although differences in quality were not always statistically significant, patterns were consistent for the majority of fruit and vegetable items. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence that variations in food quality may plausibly be a micro-environmental mediating variable in food purchase and consumption and help partially explain neighbourhood differences in food consumption patterns.

AB  - What impact will terrorism have on America’s cities? Historically, large-scale violence has impacted cities in three ways. First, concentrations of people have an advantage in defending themselves appealing in times of violence. from attackers, making cities more Second, cities often make attractive targets for violence, which creates an incentive for people to disperse. Finally, since warfare and terrorism often specifically target means of transportation, violence can increase the effective cost of transportation, which will usually increase the demand for density. Evidence on war and cities in the 20th century suggests that the effect of wars on urban form can be large (for example, Berlin in World War II), but more commonly neither terrorism nor wars have significantly altered urban form. As such, across America the effect of terrorism on cities is likely to be small. The only exception to this is downtown New York which, absent large- scale subsidies, will probably not be fully rebuilt. Furthermore, such subsidies make little sense to us.

AB  - This article examines the provision of grants to homeowners and landlords to assist them with repairs and improvements to their properties. The focus is on policy as it has been developed in England and Wales. It tracks shifts in the objectives and the form of grant aid over time since the late 1940s, influenced by considerations such as the balance in policy between demolition and renovation, the level of owner-occupation in the housing stock, the number of low-income homeowners, and the general public spending context. Shifts in the objectives of grant aid from a narrow focus on housing stock condition to a wider concern with area regeneration, community care, and environmental sustainability are also examined. More recent attempts to harness home equity for repair and improvements are considered, together with the implications of the recent growth in private renting. The article concludes that current reductions in public spending will severely affect the rate of provision of grant aid but that in the longer term, poor housing conditions affecting potentially vulnerable households in the private sector will reemerge as an important policy issue. ?? 2012 Copyright ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved..

AB  - This study examined the effects of personality (psychoticism) and nominal vs real groups using brainstorming techniques in problem solving. Subjects either brainstormed three problems on their own, in pairs or in four person groups consisting of similar personality sources. There were six dependent measures: total number of non-redundant ideas; number of 'superior' responses; a rating on the quality of the ideas; the percentage of superior responses; a creativity production rate and a self-rating of imaginativeness. It was predicted that high P scores brainstorming alone would have the highest creative scores but when they interact with similar types of individuals in group settings, their superior score rate would be overtaken by equivalent groups of low creative individuals. This prediction was supported for four person groups on the number and percentage of superior respone measures and the mean creative rate measure. Dyads total creativity scores were always lower than four person nominal or real groups or two individuals working alone. There were almost no significant interactions between personality type, group size or the tasks used. Implications for organizations is discussed and the direction of future research is examined.

Three aspects of the {ILP} scales have been studied for 9th and 11th grade high-school students. First, the internal consistency reliabilities of the {ILP} scales, two of which {DP} and {MS} were satisfactory. Second, the factor structure obtained in this study included three out of the four original factors. {FR} was not reconstructed. Third, the relationship between academic achievement and information processing of high-school students have been analyzed. Deep Processing (DP) came out as the most prominent style in its relation to academic achievement, particularly among the younger students.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE:s: Social epidemiologists have hypothesised that neighbourhood quality may exert an important contextual influence on mental and physical health. However, validated instruments do not exist for measuring neighbourhood quality in Taiwan. A self reported instrument to measure perceived neighbourhood quality in Taiwan was developed and tested. DESIGN: Community survey. SETTING: Southern Taiwan, including the metropolitan Kaohsiung area and eight surrounding communities, representing urban, suburban, and rural districts. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1084 residents, aged 18 to 75, were surveyed during 1999 to 2000. MAIN RESULTS: Using factor analysis with varimax rotation, three subscales explained 54.8% of the variance in our 15 item Neighbourhood Quality Index: perceived social capital (Cronbach alpha=0.84), perceived security (alpha=0.78), and adequacy of services and facilities (alpha=0.67). Lower perceived neighbourhood social capital (odds ratio, OR, 1.26; 95% CI: 1.21 to 1.32), lower neighbourhood security (OR 1.37; 95% CI: 1.26 to 1.48), and inadequate neighbourhood services and facilities (OR 1.17; 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.28) were all related to higher residential dissatisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: A Neighbourhood Quality Index was developed for use in Taiwan with good internal consistency and test-retest reliability, as well as convergent validity. Future studies will examine the association between this index and measures of individual mental and physical health.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyse whether or not differentiated rents reflect differences in neighbourhood quality in housing of similar quality and age in two target cities in Sweden. The system for rent setting in Sweden is partly based on a process of negotiation in which the annual change in actual rents is an outcome of negotiations between the local branch of the Swedish Union of Tenants and local municipal housing companies. One possible outcome of these negotiations could be change to the rental structure in the different neighbourhoods within the municipality. By allowing differences in negotiated rent outcomes in different neighbourhoods, a better relationship of rent level to tenant perception of neighbourhood quality can be achieved. It is the understanding of the authors that in a number of local-housing-market rent negotiations over the last decade, the parties involved have agreed on the need for and have consciously aimed towards making such adjustments. In this paper, regression analysis has been used to analyse data about rent levels for residential units from two cities in Sweden, namely Gothenburg and Lulea ˚. It can be concluded that differentiated rents are indeed present, hence the existing rent-setting system in Sweden can be used to improve the relationship between rental structure and neighbourhood quality.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objectives of this study were to examine relationships between neighbourhood-level and individual-level characteristics and physical activity in deprived London neighbourhoods.\n\nMETHODS: In 40 of the most deprived neighbourhoods in London (ranked in top 11% in London by Index of Multiple Deprivation) a cross-sectional survey (n = 4107 adults aged > = 16 years), neighbourhood audit tool, GIS measures and routine data measured neighbourhood and individual-level characteristics. The binary outcome was meeting the minimum recommended (CMO, UK) 5 × 30 mins moderate physical activity per week. Multilevel modelling was used to examine associations between physical activity and individual and neighbourhood-level characteristics.\n\nRESULTS: Respondents living more than 300 m away from accessible greenspace had lower odds of achieving recommended physical activity levels than those who lived within 300 m; from 301-600 m (OR = 0.7; 95% CI 0.5-0.9) and from 601-900 m (OR = 0.6; 95% CI 0.4-0.8). There was substantial residual between-neighbourhood variance in physical activity (median odds ratio = 1.7). Other objectively measured neighbourhood-level characteristics were not associated with physical activity levels.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Distance to nearest greenspace is associated with meeting recommended physical activity levels in deprived London neighbourhoods. Despite residual variance in physical activity levels between neighbourhoods, we found little evidence for the influence of other measured neighbourhood-level characteristics.

AB  - It has been suggested that the residential mobility behaviour and general well-being of residents of urban neighbourhoods are not only influenced by how residents themselves assess their neighbourhood, but also by how they think other city residents see their neighbourhood: the perceived reputation of the neighbourhood. There is a large body of literature on residents’ satisfaction with their neighbourhood, but much less is known about how residents perceive the reputation of their own neighbourhood. Such knowledge might give important clues on how to improve the well-being of residents in deprived neighbourhoods, not only by directly improving the factors that affect their own level of satisfaction, but also by improving the factors that residents think have a negative effect on the reputation of their neighbourhood. This paper examines whether there are differences in the determinants of neighbourhood satisfaction and the perceived reputation of the neighbourhood. Using data from a purpose-designed survey to study neighbourhood reputations in the city of Utrecht, the Netherlands, it is found that subjective assessment of the dwelling and neighbourhood attributes are more important in explaining neighbourhood satisfaction than in explaining perception of reputation. Objective neighbourhood variables are more important in explaining perception of reputation than in explaining neighbourhood satisfaction.

AB  - Over the period of March-May 1991, 1170 Arab and Jewish households in five ethnically mixed Arab-Jewish cities in Israel were surveyed. This fieldwork has involved the delivery of two questionnaires, on the basis of which generalisation for this paper became possible. From the analysis of data pertaining to people's assessment of life quality in their residential environment, that is housing and neighbourhood, perceptual differences between the Arab households and the Jewish households seem to vary along a scale of spatial ethnic mixing and from city to city. The Jews appear more satisfied or happy than the Arabs in general and especially at the city level, but such differences are not always statistically significant. Evidence of less satisfied Jewish households, most notably with regard to their neighbourhood, was uncovered and was associated with the increase in the size of the Arab population in these city subareas. This evidence and that of a similar degree of 'happiness' (or overlapping scores) emerged once the city subarea became the scale of analysis and once areas were grouped into various ranges of ethnic mixing. Shortages of housing in Arab areas and poor service provisions from the local government seem to structure the order of Arab household basic needs and thus inform their satisfaction priorities and levels.

Using a validated measure of depressive symptoms, we found that living in neighborhoods with higher housing density was associated with fewer symptoms. A larger acreage of green spaces was also linked to fewer depressive symptoms but did not reach significance in the full model. Our results suggest that how residents use the environment matters. Living in neighborhoods with a higher density of auto commuters relative to land area, an indicator of chronic noise exposure, was associated with more symptoms.

AB  - Neighbourhoods provide unequal resources and opportunities. Past research has shown that migrants are less able to move to more resourceful neighbourhoods. For Germany, cross-sectional evidence shows that migrants live in worse neighbourhoods on average, but no longitudinal analysis of changes in neighbourhood quality after residential mobility has been conducted. The present paper closes this gap and tests the place stratification model and the spatial assimilation model. Data from the German Socio-economic Panel and the MICROM dataset are used for the years 2000–09. The data are analysed using fixed-effects panel regression. The analysis shows that Turkish households are less able to improve their neighbourhood quality through moves compared with German households, while households with other ethnic backgrounds do not differ significantly from the native population.

AB  - Data from 8,032 Manitoba respondents to the 1996/97 Canadian National Population Health Survey were linked to the 1996 census to study whether measures of morbidity, both self-reported and objectively determined, were affected by neighbourhood context. Once age, gender, smoking status, diabetes, body mass index and individual income were added to individual and multi-level regression models, effects of various neighbourhood characteristics were attenuated and significant in relatively few cases. Caution is definitely called for in generalizing from studies based on one or two dependent variables. Weak relationships are likely to lead to contradictory findings with respect to the importance of neighbourhood effects.

AB  - Research on cognitive variables such as cognitive distortions, misattributions, memory and attention processes has grown substantially in the last 30years. However, little attention has been paid to the conflictive nature of schemas involved in construing self and others which might help to explain the ambivalence some people experience when facing change. Personal Construct Theory (a predecessor of many cognitive theories) has proved useful in understanding internal conflicts and fragmentation in the meaning systems with which people try to make sense of events. Our group has found a way to identify two types of conflicts or dilemmas from data collected using the Repertory Grid technique. Results suggest that those conflicts are more common in clinical samples than in control groups. Data from different studies will be presented. It supports the idea that cognitive conflicts might play a role in various clinical conditions, and especially in blocking the process of change.

AB  - This review evaluates the quality of available administrative data in the Canadian provinces, emphasizing the information needed to create integrated systems. We explicitly compare approaches to quality measurement, indicating where record linkage can and cannot substitute for more expensive record re-abstraction. Forty-nine original studies evaluating Canadian administrative data (registries, hospital abstracts, physician claims, and prescription drugs) are summarized in a structured manner. Registries, hospital abstracts, and physician files appear to be generally of satisfactory quality, though much work remains to be done. Data quality did not vary systematically among provinces. Primary data collection to check place of residence and longitudinal follow-up in provincial registries is needed. Promising initial checks of pharmaceutical data should be expanded. Because record linkage studies were ''conservative'' in reporting reliability, the reduction of time-consuming record re-abstraction appears feasible in many cases. Finally, expanding the scope of administrative data to study health, as well as health care, seems possible for some chronic conditions. The research potential of the information-rich environments being created highlights the importance of data quality.

AB  - Four out of five European citizens life in urban areas, and urban form - like the density or compactness of a city - influences daily life and is an important factor for both quality of life and environmental impact. Urban planning can influence urban form, but due to practicality needs to focus on a few indicators out of the numerous indicators which are available. The present study analyses urban form with respect to landscape metrics and population-related indicators for 231 European cities. Correlations and factor analysis identify the most relevant urban form indicators. Furthermore, a cluster analysis groups European cities according to their urban form. Significant differences between the clusters are presented. Results indicate that researchers, European administration and urban planners can select few indicators for analysing urban form due to strong relationships between single indicators. But they should be aware of differences in urban form when comparing European cities or working on planning policies for the whole of Europe. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban form is studied in a variety of disciplines in Turkey, but it has recently become central to urban studies. Histories of individual towns have usually been preoccupied with political, socio-economic and cultural issues. Archaeological excavations have made an important contribution to the reconstruction and analysis of Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine and Turkish historic cities located in Anatolia and Thrace. Urban form is often considered as a container of socio-economic processes and as a marker in the search for cultural identity in Turkey. Architectural studies have focused mainly on important buildings and housing areas. The increasingly strong morphological perspective in urban studies is part of a reaction to the loss of historical fabric associated with large-scale urban renewal schemes. Urban morphological research in Turkey is reviewed here mainly since the 1970s. A number of disciplines are covered, particularly architecture, urban planning, urban design, geography and urban history. The historical evolution of Anatolian civilizations and its impact on settlement forms is outlined. Attention is drawn in particular to the contribution of urban planning and urban history to urban morphological research. © International Seminar on Urban Form, 2010.

AB  - Disparities in housing and neighbourhood quality are endemic to cities and are linked to the wider inequalities characterising the city. In the global South, much of the urban population lives in shanty or slum settlements in which housing can lack basic amenities. In the North, state intervention has ensured that housing provision meets the basic needs, yet disparities between urban neighbourhoods are persistent. Policy attention has increasingly turned to the improvement of neighbourhood quality as a means of combating wider problems of social inequality and exclusion. These range from comprehensive neighbourhood regeneration, as in Britain, to policies advocating greater social mixing to those, such as Moving to Opportunity (MTO) in the United States, where low-income households have been enabled to move to better neighbourhoods. Such policies have attained mixed results, reflecting the conceptual uncertainties surrounding the definition of neighbourhood quality and the significance of neighbourhood as an influence on the life-chances of residents. ?? 2012 Copyright ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved..

AB  - Urban form is studied in a variety of disciplines in Ireland, but it has not, until recently, been central to urban studies. Histories of individual towns have usually been preoccupied with political, socio-economic and cultural issues. Archaeological excavations have made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Viking and Anglo-Norman towns. Map evidence is good for early-modern plantation towns. The Irish historic towns atlas provides detailed cartographic and topographical information for a growing number of towns within a chronological and thematic framework. Urban form is often considered as a container for socio-economic processes or as a marker in the search for cultural identity. Architectural studies have focused by and large on buildings of importance. While no Irish scholar has in a strict sense adopted Conzen’s method of town-plan analysis, there is evidence for the emergence of a new focus on the fabric of the urban area rather than on the special event represented by the particular building. The ‘cultural turn’ in the social sciences has favoured discussions on town plans as ideological constructs and on the importance of urban space for civic society. There appears to be an increasingly strong morphological perspective in urban studies which is likely to be a reaction to the loss of historical fabric in the context of large-scale urban renewal schemes.

AB  - The last decades have seen the emergence of the settings approach in Health Promotion one example is the Healthy City initiative which was launched by European division of WHO in 1990. In 2003, four Swedish municipalities accordingly signed a contract on a Partnership for Sustainable Welfare Development. One of the objectives was to promote participation, influence, and health at a neighbourhood level by focusing on one housing area in each municipality. These housing areas constitute the setting of this study. The purpose is to examine the implementation structures in the municipalities, and how variations in the implementation structure affect differences in integration of community participation. A triangulation of methods was used in building up a case study database: semi-structured key informant interviews with 29 stakeholders in the municipalities; examination of solicited and unsolicited documents; and participatory observations which included repeated visits to the neighbourhoods. The results show that the greater the visibility of community participation policy is in the implementation structure the greater is the integration of community participation in the neighbourhood renewal work. Two explanatory factors have been identified. The first is that making the community participation policy visible in the implementation structure results in more appropriate strategies for mobilizing the community in the neighbourhood renewal work. The second is that the municipal governing of the neighbourhood renewal allows more space for community participation when the policy is visible in the implementation structure.

AB  - This article explores the link between information technology (IT) and urban form. It does this by examining recent litera- ture pertaining to two urban theorizing traditions: the deconcentration and economic-restructuring schools. Whereas in the deconcentration school, IT–urban form rela- tionships are the newest stage in a sequence of technological innovations in transportation and communications posing new challenges to the geography of accessibility, in the restructuring school, these relationships are theorized as per- vasive sociotechnical change transforming the organization of production, institutions, and everyday life. Despite their paradigmatic differences, both schools explore urban decen- tralization and/or centralization questions and identify urban dispersing effects related to synergies between IT and the automobile society. The author uses a Dutch and a U.S. case to illustrate the challenges that informational or New Economydevelopment pose to urban andregional planning.

This study adds to the literature by (i) investigating the relationship between neighbourhood quality and child health, (ii) by utilizing subjective assessments by individuals familiar with the neighbourhood (i.e., the survey respondent and interviewer), and (iii) by utilizing multiple assessments of neighbourhood quality, and (iv) by investigating several measures of health. Other work has found that controlling for family level characteristics reduces or eliminates the apparent association between neighbourhood quality and health. We find, measuring both child well-being and neighbourhood quality multi-dimensionally, that even after controlling for family level characteristics neighbourhood quality has strong associations with child well-being. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Right timing of maintenance works both decrease the road user costs as well as maintenance costs maximising overall benefits to the society measured by Net Present Value (NPV). We present a problem of road maintenance programming as a large-scale optimisation problem, which we optimise with genetic algorithms (GA), a parallel version of GA, and a variable neighbourhood search as a post-processing step on the previous solutions. We also compared all the optimised solutions with a large number of random solutions. A case study in the Sindh Province of Pakistan shows that parallel genetic algorithms with variable neighbourhood search produce 50 percent better results compared to random sampling and 6 percent better compared to regular genetic algorithms. The case study shows that current priorities in recent years are service level upgrading and routine maintenance.

AB  - Volunteering has positive effects on adolescents' psychological and social development. However, few studies have marked a self-selection bias, suggesting that the significance of these positive consequences may decrease when volunteers' pre-participation characteristics are controlled for (e.g. Johnson, Beebe, Mortimer, & Snyder, 1998). The present short-term longitudinal study investigates the underlying dynamics of adolescents' volunteerism. First time volunteering adolescents are accessed at the time of their initial decision to volunteer on a social responsibility project and their self-perceptions (self-concept, self-esteem) and civic attitudes (social responsibility, community belonging) are compared to their peers' with similar backgrounds but did not volunteer to participate in the project. MANOVA results yielded that volunteers were more likely to be females, younger and scored higher on all measured individual characteristics compared to the non-volunteers. No significant effects of this participation were observed when pre-existing individual characteristics were controlled for. Findings are discussed in relation to developing appropriate recruitment strategies that would encourage more adolescents to be actively involved in social responsibility projects. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Light rail transit (LRT) is increasingly accompanied by overlay zoning which specifies the density and type of future development to encourage landscapes conducive to transit use. Neighbourhood type (based on land use mix) is used to partition data and investigate how pre-existing land use, treatment with a park-and-ride (PAR) versus walk-and-ride (WAR) station and overlay zoning interrelate. Hedonic models estimate capitalisation effects of LRT-related accessibility and overlay zoning on single-family houses and condos in different neighbourhoods for the system in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. Impacts differ by housing and neighbourhood type. Amenity-dominated mixed-use neighbourhoods-predominantly WAR communities-experience premiums of 6 per cent for single-family houses and over 20 per cent for condos, the latter boosted an additional 37 per cent by overlay zoning. Residential neighbourhoods-predominantly PAR communities-experience no capitalisation benefits for single-family houses and a discount for condos. The results suggest that land use mix is an important variable to select comparable neighbourhoods.

AB  - The association between neighbourhood social capital and individual health and wellbeing has been explored mainly by focussing on adult outcomes. This study explores the relationship between neighbourhood social capital and adolescent subjective wellbeing, and its interaction with adolescents' socioeconomic status. Data was taken from a random sample of 9107 students who participated in a nationally representative health survey of high school students in New Zealand in 2007. Students' wellbeing was measured by questions on general mood, life satisfaction and WHO-5 Wellbeing Index. Neighbourhood social capital was assessed according to five indicators: neighbourhood social cohesion, facilities, physical disintegration, membership in community organisations, and residential stability. All neighbourhood measures were created based on students' responses aggregated to the neighbourhood level. Neighbourhood was defined as a Census Area Unit, with a median population of 2000 people. Analyses included only neighbourhoods with more than 10 students, and were conducted using cross-classified random intercept multilevel models controlling for students' age, sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic status, with both schools and neighbourhoods treated as random effects. A total of 5567 students within 262 neighbourhoods were considered in the analysis. Students living in neighbourhoods characterised by higher levels of social cohesion and membership in community organisations reported higher levels of wellbeing. The association between student self-reported wellbeing and neighbourhood membership in community organisations varied according to the individual socioeconomic status of students. Neighbourhood membership in community organisations showed a stronger protective effect for students who were more socioeconomically deprived. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Previous research has found that mixed-handers more so than strong-handers can maintain multiple and oftentimes opposing representations simultaneously. Because of this, mixed-handers demonstrate greater Stroop interference and better appreciate visual paradoxes. The current study was designed to extend this work into the area of counterfactual production. Specifically, 126 undergraduate students at a small midwestern university were asked to read, one at a time, 4 scenarios (two with positive and two with negative outcomes) and generate as many alternative-action outcome sequences (i.e., counterfactuals) as they could in 5 min. The results indicated that mixed-handers generated significantly more upward and downward counterfactuals than strong-handers, confirming our prediction. This finding lends additional support to the notion that strength of handedness predicts one's level of interhemispheric interconnectivity and suggests that mixed- and strong-handers may show differences in a variety of decision making phenomena related to counterfactualizing such as hindsight bias and decision regret. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: To examine whether there is an association between neighbourhood deprivation and diagnosed childhood obesity, after accounting for family- and individual-level socio-demographic characteristics. Methods: An open cohort of all children aged 0-14 years was followed between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2010. Childhood residential locations were geocoded and classified according to neighbourhood deprivation. Data were analysed by multilevel logistic regression, with family- and individual-level characteristics at the first level and level of neighbourhood deprivation at the second level. Results: During the study period, among a total of 948,062 children, 10,799 were diagnosed with childhood obesity. Age-adjusted cumulative incidence for diagnosed childhood obesity increased with increasing level of neighbourhood deprivation. Incidence of diagnosed childhood obesity increased with increasing neighbourhood-level deprivation across all family and individual-level socio-demographic categories. The odds ratio (OR) for diagnosed childhood obesity for those living in high-deprivation neighbourhoods versus those living in low-deprivation neighbourhoods was 2.44 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.22-2.68). High neighbourhood deprivation remained significantly associated with higher odds of diagnosed childhood obesity after adjustment for family- and individual-level socio-demographic characteristics (OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.55-1.89). Age, middle level family income, maternal marital status, low level education, living in large cities, advanced paternal and maternal age, family history of obesity, parental history of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alcoholism and personal history of diabetes were all associated with higher odds of diagnosed childhood obesity. Conclusions: Our results suggest that neighbourhood characteristics affect the odds of diagnosed childhood obesity independently of family- and individual-level socio-demographic characteristics. © 2014 S.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purposes of this study are to determine (i) if neighbourhood socioeconomic status (SES) is systematically related to the prevalence of overweight children and youth in Canada, (ii) if the factors accounting for the apparent relationship have face validity, and (iii) if neighbourhood SES has an independent influence on this distribution.\n\nMETHODS: Cross-sectional data from Cycle 4 (2000/2001) of the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth were used. Children and youth aged 5 to 17 were included. Overweight was established using age and sex cut-off points. Neighbourhood socioeconomic data were obtained from the Statistics Canada 2001 Dissemination Area databases and SES quartiles constructed using a composite of socio-economic variables. Hierarchical non-linear modelling was used to test for independent neighbourhood effects.\n\nRESULTS: A gradient of increasing overweight prevalence by decreasing neighbourhood SES quartiles was observed (24% high SES, 30% mid-high SES, 33% mid-low SES, 35% low SES). Controlling for individual age, gender, family income and education hierarchical analysis found that a child's odds of being overweight increases if living in a low versus a high SES neighbourhood (OR=1.29, 95% CI=1.14-1.46).\n\nINTERPRETATION: The prevalence of child and youth overweight in Canada is inversely and statistically significantly related to neighbourhood SES. Independent effects indicate that neighbourhood characteristics directly influence the odds of being overweight. This research suggests that consideration of opportunity structures that exist in different types of neighbourhoods is fundamentally important to health promotion and disease prevention strategies.

AB  - Paper presented to the annual European Real Estate Conference, Milan, 2-5 June, 2004. A number of models of sustainable urban form have been promoted but the concept has not been subject to a fundamental review of its theoretical and empirical underpinnings. Sustainable urban form implies an inter-linkage of sound environmental, social and economic foundations. This paper initially focuses on the nature of the economic debate surrounding sustainable urban forms. It then considers the principal elements of urban form - land use patterns, position/ transport infrastructure, density, characteristics of the built environment. From this base it considers the underlying urban economic forces that shape these elements and their impact in turn on the urban economy. The role of transport infrastructure and spatial real estate markets is highlighted in the determination of urban form. The paper suggests an alternative formulation of the approach to urban sustainability that requires as a necessary condition a viable real estate sector with sustainable markets. As a consequence the paper argues the need for policy to understand and shape functional (sub) land use market/ catchment areas.

The first papers are concerned with fundamental issues of definition and of political constraints on action in cities.

AB  - Using data from the first two waves (in 2001/02 and 2004) of the UK's Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), we attempted to separate the effect of residential mobility from the effect of neighbourhood deprivation on children's emotional and behavioural problems. Our sample was 23,162 children (aged 3-16 years) clustered in 12,692 families. We measured neighbourhood deprivation with the Index of Multiple Deprivation, a measure of neighbourhood-level socio-economic disadvantage, and residential mobility as household move between waves. Being in a lower deprivation neighbourhood at Wave 1 was related to lower scores of both emotional and behavioural problems 2 years later, even after adjustment for child's age and sex, family adversity, family structure and maternal psychological distress. However, children whose families subsequently moved-even within or between lower deprivation neighbourhoods-were at higher risk of emotional and behavioural problems.

AB  - A great deal of research has focused on eyewitness identification performance as a function of sequential versus simultaneous lineup presentation methods. We examined if individual differences in cognitive ability influence eyewitness identification, and whether these factors lead to performance differences as a function of lineup presentation method. We found that individual differences in facial recognition ability, working memory capacity, and levels of autistic traits, did result in differential performance. Differences in lineup performance are due to the interaction of individual differences and presentation method, signaling that it is possible to enhance the accuracy of eyewitness identifications by tailoring a lineup presentation method to the capabilities of an individual eyewitness. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Four studies were conducted to develop and validate a measure of individual differences in attitudes towards gossip (ATG). In Study 1, exploratory factor analyses of responses to a pool of ATG items identified two factors reflecting attitudes about gossip's Social Value (SV) and Moral Value (MV), which provided the basis for constructing a 12-item ATG scale. In Study 2, the SV and MV factors were verified with confirmatory analysis. In Studies 3 and 4, the construct validity of the ATG scale was evidenced by (1) the ability of the SV subscale to predict interest in and intent to transmit gossip, (2) positive correlations with the Tendency to Gossip Questionnaire (Nevo, Nevo, & Derech-Zehavi, 1994) and (3) negative correlations with social approval needs.

AB  - Arguments about sustainable urban form have generally been in normative terms without recourse to its practicality. The paper shows that the essential elements of urban form are outcomes of real estate markets. The focus of the research is to examine the economic sustainability constraints to the adaptation of the existing urban form via housing market development viability. To address the task a number of econometric models are linked together to estimate spatial patterns of viability in five cities. The results demonstrate a substantial difference between cities that can be attributed not to urban form per se but to socioeconomic factors. This demonstrates that in practice it is impossible to divorce the physical structure of cities from their economic and social structure. Viability is also influenced strongly by public policy through the location of social housing. The research suggests that a driving force/constraint for development viability is the level of neighbourhood house prices. Large swathes of negative viability are found even without accounting for the additional costs of brownfield development, suggesting that there are major constraints to the reconfiguration of housing markets in some cities in a piecemeal way.

AB  - The author examines the ways that Individual Psychology and environmental psychology may mutually inform each other and thus be of benefit to Individual Psychologists. Adler's acknowledgment of environmental influences on lifestyle makes selected theories and research from environmental psychology concerning crowding, underpopulation theory, and sense of place meaningful constructs for Individual Psychologists. Implications of these theories for the practice of Individual Psychology are discussed. Individual Psychology has relevance for environmental psychology in that the cumulative behaviors of individuals affect environmental quality. Adlerian social interest suggests a parallel construct of environmental interest that embodies people's care and conservation of the environment. Conversely, personal superiority striving displaced onto their physical surroundings may explain the behavior of some to dominate and to exploit the environment. Finally, experiencing and caring for the environment may contribute to psychological health and to feelings of belonging and completion in a manner that parallels the embodiment of social interest.
