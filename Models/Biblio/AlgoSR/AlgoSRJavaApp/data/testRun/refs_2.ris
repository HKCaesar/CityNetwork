AB  - The ever increasing negative impact of global warming has reminded all\nof us in transportation professionals the importance of low carbon\nemission transportation system design, planning, and practices. With\nurbanization accelerating in the U.S., Asia, Europe, and other parts of\nthe world, building a sustainable multi-modal transportation network to\naccommodate the residents' transportation needs and cut down greenhouse\ngas emissions in cities around the world has become a very important\nchallenge. The purpose of this paper is to showcase the successful\nstories of cities who are meeting this challenge head on by building\nsustainable multi-modal transportation network. Six major cities in\nthree continents that the authors personally visited will be showcased\nin this paper. From Europe, we have Paris, France and London, England.\nFrom Asia, we have Hong Kong and Tokyo, Japan. From America, we have New\nYork City and San Francisco. Lessons learned from these six cities were\nsummarized and presented in this paper. Hong Kong comes out on top and\nis recognized as the most sustainable multi-modal transportation network\ndesign. It is believed that success can be duplicated if the process is\nclearly documented and benefits truly understood by all transportation\nprofessionals.

AB  - Genome-wide analysis of DNA copy-number changes using microarray-based technologies has enabled the detection of de novo cryptic chromosome imbalances in approximately 10% of individuals with mental retardation. So far, the majority of these submicroscopic microdeletions/duplications appear to be unique, hampering clinical interpretation and genetic counselling. We hypothesised that the genomic regions involved in these de novo submicroscopic aberrations would be candidates for recurrent copy-number changes in individuals with mental retardation. To test this hypothesis, we used multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to screen for copy number changes at eight genomic candidate regions in a European cohort of 710 individuals with idiopathic mental retardation. By doing so, we failed to detect additional submicroscopic rearrangements, indicating that the anomalies tested are non-recurrent in this cohort of patients. The break points flanking the candidate regions did not contain low copy repeats and/or sequence similarities, thus providing an explanation for its non-recurrent nature. On the basis of these data, we propose that the use of genome-wide microarrays is indicated when testing for copy-number changes in individuals with idiopathic mental retardation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve occurs at a frequency of about 0.5% and usually on the right side. The identification of a non-recurrent laryngeal nerve may be difficult. We describe a new method for its identification using intraoperative neurostimulation. METHODS: We examined nine patients with a non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve and five patients with a normal inferior laryngeal nerve anatomy who were operated on trans-sternally. Neurostimulation of the vagal nerve producing electromyographic signal in the intrinsic laryngeal musculature was performed at different points proximally and distally. RESULTS:: Electromyographic signals were found proximally but not distally of the separation of the inferior laryngeal nerve from the vagus in 14 patients. In nine patients with a non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve, we performed neurostimulation of the vagus opposite the lower and the upper thyroid poles. In all patients we found no electromyographic signals at the distal stimulation point. In contrast, proximal neurostimulation of the vagus opposite the upper thyroid pole produced positive electromyographic signals. CONCLUSION: Neurostimulation of the vagal nerve distally of the separation of the inferior laryngeal nerve did not produce electromyographic signals in the intrinsic laryngeal musculature, perhaps due to the different modalities in the vagal fascicles. Negative electromyographic signals following neurostimulation of the distal vagal nerve opposite the lower thyroid pole should lead to proximal neurostimulation of the vagus opposite the upper thyroid pole. Positive electromyographic signals proximally and negative electromyographic signals distally predict the occurrence of a non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve which allows its diagnosis before surgical dissection of the thyroid gland and may prevent nerve palsy.

AB  - Purpose of the study: We aimed to highlight a rare anatomical variation involving the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and to emphasise its implications for thyroid surgery. Materials and methods: Over a period of 13 years, 993 patients underwent thyroid surgery; 1557 recurrent laryngeal nerves (887 on the right side) were exposed. Results: Three non-recurrent laryngeal nerves were found on the right side, associated with a retro-oesophageal subclavian artery. One case was suspected before surgery. Discussion: Several variations in the path and branches of the recurrent laryngeal nerve have been reported in the literature. The frequency of occurrence of a non-recurrent laryngeal nerve is about 1 per cent, for patients undergoing thyroid surgery. Other surgically relevant anatomical variations of the recurrent laryngeal nerve include associations with the inferior thyroid artery and the presence of nerve branches. Conclusion: The recurrent laryngeal nerve must be carefully dissected and totally exposed during thyroid surgery in order to best preserve its function. Moreover, the thyroid surgeon must be aware of the existence of anatomical variations, which are not as rare as one may think.

AB  - This paper presents the ground work necessary to study the evolving air transportation industry. A survey of related models based on a system-of-systems perspective results in a methodology formulated to address overlooked areas such as market coordination and competition. An agent-based modeling approach underpins the integration of the demand-side (consumers) and supply-side (service providers) entities to effectively capture the dynamic interactions between these stakeholders within the National Transportation System. Machine Learning techniques are adopted to model the competitive sentience of air service providers in making decisions that affect consumers' travel demand over time and vice versa. An interim model is developed employing this methodology on a four-node, inter-city transportation network, and has shown promising results toward further development efforts.

AB  - A wide range of energy forms are being consumed, including natural gas (NG) for industrial uses and heating, electricity for light and to power electronic devices, petrochemicals to produce plastics, and petroleum derivatives such as gasoline and diesel for transportation. Because modern life is based on energy, individuals, corporations, and firms should have a reliable access to energy in all its forms. Problems involving the continuous transportation and delivery of energy can lead to the disruption and breakdown of economic, industrial, and social infrastructures. An energy resource cannot be reliable unless, first, it is delivered to right place at the right time, and secondly, it must be available in the consumer-desired quantity. Maintaining the efficient and reliable generation, transportation, and distribution of energy is the most important in a world, which is so dependent on energy. Different kinds of energy are used in today's industries and in people's lives. Some are fossil fuel resources such as oil and gas, but electricity, nuclear energy, solar energy resources, wind energy, and wave energy are also being used. All of these types should be delivered to consumers. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - "As traditional sources of funding for the nation's surface transportation system fail to keep pace with demand, proposals for new sources have proliferated. New funding strategies, such as pricing the use of new and existing roads, and new institutional arrangements, such as public-private partnerships, have emerged over the past few years. As with all transportation policies, these strategies raise questions about equity. To address these concerns, the Transportation Research Board convened an expert committee to provide guidance to public officials about assessing the equity of evolving transportation finance mechanisms. The committee's findings are presented in this report. They are organized under the following chapter headings: (1) Equity and Transportation Finance; (2) How Transportation is Funded and Who Pays; (3) Equity Through Different Lenses; (4) Transportation Finance Equity: Evidence and Experience; (5) Equity and Decision Making: Experience with Road Pricing; and (6) Findings and Recommendations."--pub. desc.

AB  - Severe immune dysfunction is an established risk factor of lymphoma, but the role of moderate alterations of immunity is not clear and prospective investigations are needed. We examined several immune-related disorders and medications in relation to non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the Multiethnic Cohort. Over 215,000 subjects of African American, Caucasian, Japanese American, Latino and Native Hawaiian ancestry aged 45-75 years completed a questionnaire, including information on medical history, in 1993-1996. After exclusions, we performed Cox regression among 193,050 cohort members including 939 incident NHL cases while adjusting for sex, age, ethnicity, education, body mass index and alcohol intake. Self-reported diabetes was not associated with NHL overall, but was positively associated with risk among Japanese Americans [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.55; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-2.17]. Participants with a history of blood transfusion were at increased risk with HR = 1.39 (95% CI: 1.06-1.84) in men and HR = 1.22 (95% CI: 0.94-1.58) in women, especially for the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma subtype. History of asthma or other allergies was associated with elevated risk only among Latinos (HR = 1.46; 95% CI: 1.07-2.00) who also showed a significant relation between current use of antihistamines and NHL (HR = 1.80; 95% CI: 1.09-2.97). Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was not associated with NHL. Our findings from this large prospective study support a moderate risk for NHL related to blood transfusions, current long-term antihistamine use and diabetes, but the associations were limited to certain ethnic groups and require further replications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve (NRILN) is a nerve anomaly that is associated with the developmentally aberrant subclavian artery. Thus, it is possible to predict NRILN by preoperative diagnosis of an aberrant subclavian artery. Preoperative recognition of the NRILN should be advantageous in the prevention of intraoperative nerve damage. The purpose of this study was to assess the possibility of diagnosis of an aberrant subclavian artery by computed tomography (CT) of the neck, which is often performed before thyroid surgery. METHODS: We retrospectively studied the preoperative CT films from 594 thyroid or esophageal surgery patients treated in our hospital between May 1995 and December 2000. An NRILN was identified intraoperatively in 6 of these patients, and a right recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve (RILN) was observed in 588 of these patients. We evaluated whether the brachiocephalic artery could be identified on the CT scan and classified the positional relationship between the right subclavian artery and the tracheoesophagus into three types. RESULTS: The brachiocephalic artery was identified on the CT films in 158 cases, all of which were cases of RILN. The right subclavian artery was detected on the ventral side of the membranous wall of the trachea in all 588 RILN cases, whereas it was detected on the dorsal side in all 6 NRILN cases. CONCLUSIONS: It was possible to predict an aberrant subclavian artery by identifying the brachiocephalic artery and position of the right subclavian artery on the CT film of the neck. When an anomaly of the subclavian artery is thus preoperatively detected, NRILN can be preoperatively predicted, which likely will enable prevention of vocal cord paralysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigated whether abnormal circulation of macromolecular IgA and IgA with altered glycosylation or electrical charge plays a role in the recurrence of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) after transplantation. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 92 renal transplant patients were enrolled; 52 IgAN patients and 40 with other non-IgAN. The IgAN group included 10 patients showing IgA mesangial deposits in the grafted kidneys (recurrent group) and 10 who did not (immunohistochemically proven non-recurrent group). In addition another 22 IgAN transplant patients were clinically free of recurrent disease. METHODS: The analyses included macromolecular IgA (IgAIC) detected by the conglutinin assay (K), heavy IgA precipitated in 2.5% polyethylene glycol (PEG), IgA-fibronectin aggregates (IgA/F Aggr), mixed IgA/IgGIC, IgA binding to mesangial matrix components (fibronectin, laminin, type IV collagen) or polycations (poly-L-lysine) and IgA with altered glycosylation (Jacalin-binding assay). RESULTS: After transplantation, IgAN patients displayed significantly higher mean levels for each variable measured than non-IgAN (ANOVA, P < 0.05). By stepwise regression analysis, the binding of IgA to fibronectin had the highest coefficient. By comparing data in recurrent and clinically non-recurrent IgAN, we observed that two groups could be distinguished by the results of the two assays for macromolecular IgA (conglutinin IgAIC and IgA-fibronectin aggregates) and IgA with increased affinity for type IV collagen (P < 0.05). When the selected group of immunohistochemically proven non-recurrent IgAN was compared to the recurrent one, a statistically significant difference was found only for the binding of IgA to type IV collagen (P < 0.05). Data from this test were significantly related with proteinuria (P < 0.05) and microscopic haematuria (P < 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Even though the IgA serology of renal transplant IgAN patients shows peculiar features and recurrent and non-recurrent IgAN differ in many aspects, the prevalence of positive data in the two groups had no predictive value. This suggests that the recurrence of IgAN is modulated by factors affecting the interaction between circulating abnormal IgA and mesangial cells and/or matrix.

AB  - Evaluation of the p53 gene protein expression and proliferative potential with MIB-1 monoclonal antibody (MBL Co.), a new marker of cellular proliferation that binds Ki67 in paraffin sections, by immunohistochemical studies were made in 10 cases of the non-recurrent meningiomas and the 8 cases (17 samples) of the recurrent meningiomas. Tissue samples were embedded in paraffin after fixation in 10% formalin, and 3-microns sections were activated by microwave heating before being immersed with p53 protein or MIB-1 monoclonal antibody. The positivity of immunostaining for p53 protein and MIB-1 was calculated as the % values of tumor cell nuclei stained to all tumor cell nuclei examined within several fields under a light microscope. The mean % value of the proliferating cell index (PCI) stained with MIB-1 monoclonal antibody was 2.1% in the non-recurrent meningiomas, and high values of 11.9% were obtained for the recurrent meningiomas. High values of PCI exceeding 3% were indicated in most of the cases of recurrent meningiomas. p53 protein was not found in the 10 cases of non-recurrent meningiomas. However, it was positive showing values of 0.5-8.5% (mean; 3.4%) in 5 of the 8 cases of recurrent meningiomas. 2 of 4 cases of recurrent meningiomas with a benign type of histology at both initial discovery and recurrence revealed p53 protein expression in the tumor tissues. 3 of 4 cases of recurrent meningiomas, which were of the benign type at the initial operation but transformed to the malignant (atypical) type on recurrence, demonstrated positive staining for p53 protein in the tumor tissues. Although positivity for p53 protein was observed in the recurrent meningiomas with high values of PCI with MIB-1, no significant correlation between the values of PCI with MIB-1 and those for the p53 protein expression was found. The p53 gene protein may be altered on tumor recurrence and/or malignant transformation in meningiomas. It is concluded that evaluations of the p53 protein expression and proliferative potential with MIB-1 are important as additional factors for the prediction of tumor recurrence in meningiomas.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-recurrent laryngeal nerve, a rare anomaly, passes transversely into larynx with or without its recurrent branches directly arising from the vagus nerve. The paper investigates clinical significance of non-recurrent laryngeal nerve during thyroid surgery. Clinical data from 5 cases of non-recurrent laryngeal nerve and related literature reviews were made to acknowledge its incidence, variant types and matters concerned during thyroid operations. CASE REPORT: 821 recurrent laryngeal nerves were anatomized during 2496 thyroid operations, from which 5 were confirmed to hold non-recurrent laryngeal nerves (0.61%). 3 patients were found to have non-recurrent laryngeal nerves during re-operation because of voice horse after the first operation which improved much after re-operation. The other two patients were recognized during the first operation. All 5 cases were not diagnosed preoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Non-recurrent laryngeal nerve, a rare anomaly, is very vulnerable during thyroid surgery. It is helpful to avoid injuring non-recurrent laryngeal nerve that identification of the non-recurrent laryngeal nerve and its types.

AB  - Automated incident detection and alternative path planning form important activities within a modern expressway traffic management system which aims to ensure a smooth flow of traffic along expressways. This is done by adopting efficient technologies and processes that can be directly applied for the automated detection of non-recurrent congestion, the formulation of response strategies, and the use of management techniques to suggest alternative routes to the road-users, resulting in significant overall reductions in both congestion and inconvenience to motorists. A delicate balance has to be struck here between the incident detection rate and the false-alarm rate. This paper presents the development of a hybrid artificial intelligence technique for automatically detecting incidents on a traffic network. The overall framework, algorithm development, implementation and evaluation of this hybrid fuzzy-logic genetic-algorithm technique are discussed in the paper. A cascaded framework of 11 fuzzy controllers takes in traffic indices such as occupancy and volume, to detect incidents along an expressway in California. The flexible and robust nature of the developed fuzzy controller allows it to model functions of arbitrary complexity, while at the same time being inherently highly tolerant of imprecise data. The maximizing capabilities of genetic algorithms, on the other hand, enable the fuzzy design parameters to be optimized to achieve optimal performance. The results obtained for the traffic network give a high detection rate of 70.0%, while giving a low false-alarm rate of 0.83%. A comparison between this approach and four other incident-detection algorithms demonstrates the superiority of this approach.

AB  - Background: The aim of this prospective study was to identify the arterial anomalies constantly associated with nonrecurrent inferior laryngeal nerve by preoperative ultrasonography and impact on recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve palsy (RILN). Method: The study included 332 patients who underwent thyroidectomy or parathyroidectomy between 2009 February and 2011 October. Preoperative ultrasonography was performed to all patients to identify vascular anomalies related to NRILN. CT was performed only in patients with NRILN predicted with preoperative ultrasonography. Systematic nerve dissection was performed surgically. Patient characteristics, type of NRILN, preoperative and postoperative vocal cord mobility and morbidity were recorded. Results: The NRILN was identified in 6 patients on the right side (1.94%). Preoperative ultrasonography predicted NRILN in all cases (accuracy 100%). Conclusion: Ultrasonography is a very reliable and simple method to be used in preoperative assessment to identify vascular anomaly associated with NRILN to make optimal surgical decisions against nerve damage in patients undergoing thyroidectomy or parathyroidectomy. Adequate surgical technique is of great importance. © 2012 Surgical Associates Ltd.

In the experiment, a network growth simulator program (SONG) was incorporated into a senior/graduate class in transportation system analysis. Results of the experiment show that the use of SONG effectively enhanced students' learning in terms of helping students develop in-depth understanding about the development process of network patterns, and helped them develop some aspects of judgment, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. However the use of SONG may have been more effective had some other barriers to learning been overcome.

In one, the predicted anomaly of dorsal origin of the right subclavian artery was confirmed by intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IVDSA). The surgical anatomy and embryology of this rare condition are discussed. Non-recurrent laryngeal nerves are at increased risk of injury, especially during re-operative thyroid surgery. It is, therefore, suggested that an IVDSA be performed in that small subset of patients in whom re-operative thyroid surgery is contemplated on the right, and in whom the nerve was not found at the previous operation.

AB  - The clinical relationship of the stapedial reflex with the facial function has been investigated to evaluate its prognostic accuracy in a group of non recurrent and recurrent Bell's palsy patients. One hundred and fifty-eight consecutive patients were examined. One hundred and thirty-three presented a unilateral non recurrent palsy, 16 a unilateral recurrent paralysis, while the remaining 9 complained an alternating paralysis. In the unilateral non recurrent Bell's palsy a good correlation between the evolution of the stapedial reflex and the recovery of facial function was found. This observation was not seen in the other types of paralysis. The conclusion of this paper demonstrates that the stapedial reflex is a reliable prognostic indicator only in the non recurrent Bell's palsy.

AB  - When evaluating the earthquake risk to transportation system it is important to take into account the integrated effect of ground motion, liquefaction, and landslides on the network components and system. In this article, the risk from earthquakes to a transportation system is evaluated in terms of direct loss from damage to bridges and travel delays in the transportation network. The contribution of site effects to the loss from damage to bridges is estimated using the San Francisco Bay area as a test bed. Damage and loss to bridges from ground shaking and ground displacements (vertical and horizontal) from liquefaction and landslides are computed for a magnitude 7.0 scenario earthquake on the Hayward fault in California. It is found that liquefaction damage is the largest contributor to the repair cost which is used as a measure of the loss from damage. The performance of the transportation network is evaluated in terms of travel delay times. Travel delays resulting from damage due to ground shaking and changes in travel times are evaluated for the scenario event under the assumptions of fixed and variable travel demands. It is found that with fixed travel demand, the post-event travel times increase significantly. Travel times remain relatively unchanged and decrease with the variable demand time assumption.

AB  - Although approximately 50% of patients with non-invasive (Ta) papillary transitional cell carcinoma show no recurrence of their disease, current histopathological approaches cannot distinguish this sub-group from those patients in whom the disease will recur. In this 5 year retrospective study, we have shown that cytokeratin 20 (CK20) was expressed in 19 of 29 (65.5%) of non-invasive papillary tumours of grades 1 or 2. CK20 expression patterns were predictive of disease non-recurrence in a sub-group of eight patients, representing 51.7% of patients with non-recurrent disease. In normal bladder mucosa, CK20 expression was restricted to the terminally-differentiated superficial cell. In eight CK20-positive tumours which showed no recurrence at 5 years, CK20 expression was either restricted to, or most intense in, the luminal cells of the papillae. This pattern of expression was not seen in any of the 15 tumours from the recurrent group. Disruption of normal CK20 expression was highly significantly correlated with recurrent tumours. These results suggest that changes in the expression of differentiation-associated antigens, such as CK20, may be useful in predicting benign versus malignant behaviour and may, therefore, be useful in defining treatment strategies.

AB  - A dynamic traffic allocation algorithm based on packet delay and hops in Mobile Ad hoc networks is proposed. The algorithm is based on the minimization product of delay and the number of hops in each path and adjusts the traffic adaptively so as to make load-balanced which optimizes network resource utilization. Simulation demonstrated that the algorithm could dynamically balance the traffic allocation between paths. The aim of the minimum utilization of resource in mobile Ad hoc networks can be achieved.

AB  - The major issue related to the realization of multipath network is the design of suitable dynamic adjustment algorithm of traffic allocation. The design challenge is to guarantee the various qualities of service requirements for all traffic, special the loss rate while minimizing the cost function. In this paper a novel traffic allocation algorithm based on time series prediction and PSO (particle swarm optimization) is proposed. The paper describes how the algorithm dynamically predicts loss levels over all available network paths and adjusts the traffic allocation proportion of packets for next prediction period by the adaptive PSO. Simulation results show the superiority of our algorithm over equality splitting algorithm.

AB  - Fluctuations in roadway capacity due to non-recurrent traffic incidents is a source of uncertainty of travel time. Travel time reliability, as a transportation performance measure, which may reflect travel time uncertainty was applied to network analysis. Recently, research which applies network reliability concepts to transportation network design has been undertaken. In this study, a continuous network design problem (CNDP) with a travel time reliability constraint was formulated as a bi-level model. A simulation-based genetic algorithm with penalty method was used to obtain the optimal capacity enhancement of each link, combined with a routine which estimates travel time reliability under fluctuations of link capacity. The effect of the travel time constraint on a CNDP was analyzed through a numerical experiment using a simple network. Additionally, the effect of budget allocation and factors to be specified in the model on the results were analyzed.

AB  - This study focuses on grasping the spatial changes that have taken place in a provincial city and aims to clarify the decision making processes of administrators and public transportation companies in Nagano City from a spatial point of view. Geographic studies of public transportation can be divided into two categories: those that put the emphasis on the spatial analysis of the network, and those that are descriptive accounts of the development of transportation in a community. This study attempts to clarify the spatiotemporal nodal structure, taking into account both the spatial profile and transitions over time. Metrical analysis and historical description, two previously separate methodologies, were combined to achieve this objective. Specifically, we first performed an analysis of the spatial structure of the public transportation network as it has gone through yearly changes. Then we examined how the decision making of the administrative and contracting arms has progressed in response to these changes. Finally, we looked into the influence such decisions have had on changes in public transportation. Factor analysis, based on the number of bus and railway runs flow, was used to clarify the changes in nodal structures. These results were then used to compare the convenience of public transportation in various districts in the city with consideration of the population distribution. As a result, with the exception of the central area of Nagano City where buses and railways are concentrated, the nodal structure on the whole experienced a simplification in the decade from 1990 to 2000 due to the decrease in inter-district connections. The disparity in the convenience of public transportation between the central and surrounding districts has also grown due to the deteriorating connections in surrounding districts. However, this gap was also likely subject to the influence of the Nagano Olympics and the extension of the Nagano Shinkansen in the central part of the city. Although the administration has been trying to reduce the number of areas with poor public transit access to minimize the disparity, which has increased due to the change in network spatial patterns, to date it has continued to give priority to ensuring access for citizens traveling in the central urban areas. Currently, given the fact that the number of passengers is not expected to increase, railway companies are focusing on increasing the carrying capacity and linking the rail transportation with other types of transportation in some of the busier zones. Also, bus companies are reducing and eliminating/merging some routes, while trying to maintain the existing service lines, which are still in high demand. The administration is encouraging policies to reduce poor-access areas, whereas the transportation companies are trying to improve the efficiency of the existing network, and although both are working toward improvement, differences of opinion are bound to occur because of the different strategies. In conclusion, to understand the spatial pattern change in public transportation, it is necessary not only to follow the tendencies over time but also to have a clear view of the decisions made and especially policies formed by the administration and the companies.

AB  - Various growth factors are expressed in nasal polyps, and some of these have been suggested to play a role in polyp formation. A potential relation between growth factor expression and polyp recurrence, however, is undetermined. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is expressed in mononuclear cells, as well as in endothelial and epithelial surface and gland cells of nasal polyps. To determine whether bFGF may play a role in the recurrence of nasal polyps, the present study aimed at a comparison of bFGF expression in recurrent versus non-recurrent polyps. Further, the expression in polyps from asthmatic patients was compared with that from non-asthmatics. Thirty patients with newly diagnosed nasal polyposis were included. Polypectomy was performed at entry to the long-term follow-up study. Fifteen patients only had one polypectomy (no recurrence group, with a median observation time of 81 months). Fifteen patients had a median of 6.4 polypectomies (multiple recurrence group, with a median observation time of 108 months). Five of nine patients with asthma belonged to the non-recurrence group and four to the recurrence group. The polyp from the entrance polypectomy was examined for expression of bFGF by immunohistochemistry, using a polyclonal antibody. A masked semi-quantification of staining intensity was performed in recurrent versus non-recurrent polyps, as well as in asthmatics versus non-asthmatics. bFGF expression was seen as varying staining of the polyp surface and gland epithelium, as well as of some mononuclear cells and some fibroblast-like cell profiles in the polyp stroma. Vascular endothelium was labeled occasionally. Semi-quantification of the staining intensity showed no significant differences between recurrent and non-recurrent polyps, or between asthmatics and non-asthmatics. We conclude that the level of immunohistochemical expression of bFGF in recurrent and non-recurrent nasal polyposis is equivalent. Thus, the level of bFGF expression in the primary polyp can not predict a subsequent recurrence. The expression of bFGF is not up-regulated in patients with asthma. Further studies are needed to determine a potential role of bFGF in nasal polyposis, with special reference to different stages of polyp formation and growth.

AB  - A public transportation network serves in adequate way a population if it evolves in time following the existent social reality. Changes made in order to improve service must be analyzed and evaluated. The introduction of modern technology to validate the fare card allowed a quick access to important, although incomplete, data. Databases with only the getting in validation information can be used to construct an origin-destination (OD) matrix, allowing a service quality analysis. Here it is presented a basic methodology to rigorously validate service quality criteria considering what might be interesting for the user. The quality analysis philosophy is the following. First, based on automatically gathered data, one reconstructs the origin-destination (OD) matrix, which contains information concerning the number of passengers traveling between zones of a certain region. The OD matrix is used to calculate some criteria characterizing the transportation network quality, such as traveling times, waiting times at a stop or transport occupation. The reconstructed OD matrix always contains errors, which cause errors in the criteria values. How significant are these errors? This question can be answered using our criteria validating methodology, which is based on statistical analysis. It has been implemented at the urban bus transport system of Porto, STCP, allowing the evaluation of the transportation network quality under a number of criteria and guaranteeing rigorous results. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we focus on the optimization of total cost for regional containers transportation network system of seaports, and propose a new reliable intelligent algorithm, named Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). ACO is to solve the nonlinear NP-complete problems, which is greatly inspired from real ants and their food seeking behavior. The paper constructs an optimization model for certain containers transportation network system and simulates the whole process. The results show the improved ACO Algorithm is of a credible and excellent probability accumulation searching method to reduce the integrated cost of container transportation network obviously. The optimization model that we constructed provides a reference model for containers transportation network layout.

AB  - In 1997, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) will be reauthorized, and the formula for distributing federal highway funds to states is likely to be a key issue in the reauthorization process. One reason for the upcoming formula debate is that the current allocation process is not reflective of current federal objectives in transportation. Alternative proposals for distributing federal highway funds have already been introduced to Congress. ISTEA reauthorization will provide Congress with an opportunity to review the federal objectives in transportation and to reflect these objectives in the distribution of federal highway funds to states. In preparation for this debate, alternative scenarios for distributing federal highway funds are explored, and the scenarios are evaluated on the basis of the present overarching federal objectives in transportation. Included in this process is an evaluation of formula factors, such as lane miles and vehicle miles traveled, that make up individual scenarios. The goal is to encourage debate on and add to the discussion of how federal highway funds are or should be distributed to states.

AB  -  Having not considered such aspects as spatial distribution features of transportation networks and resident areas, the spatial influence of outside transportation modes on the features within the research regions as well as the different transit capacity of different transportation ways, the conventional measuring methods based on path analysis and network analysis are deficient to the description of regional transportation situation. With the employment and optimization of the connectivity and accessibility of the network nodes to evaluate transportation network, this study successfully breaks through the limitation of the border of investigative area and, different transportation modes can also be taken into account. Based on the gradually increased correlation coefficient between the connectivity change, which is a gradually increased process from direct connections to indirect multi-steps connections, and the development of regional economy, this paper proposes economy-network diameter index (ENDI), which is employed to evaluate the development of network and the contribution to regional economy of Gansu Province, China with the data of 2002 transportation network and the economic statistics in the Statistical Yearbook. By above methods, this empirical study comes to the following conclusions: 1) interregional transportation contributes more to the development of regional economic than that of the adjoining transportation; and 2) these indices can be used to designate spatial interactional scopes of regional economy, and accordingly to provide powerful and scientific supports for the planning of regional transportation and economy; and 3) the accessibility figure of network nodes shows that transportation of Gansu Province takes on a phenomenon of high cluster and spatial autocorrelation; and 4) ENDI can also be used to create spatial weight matrix of spatial progress. As calculation of these indices is laborious, several efficient computational methods are developed.

AB  - Consolidating small freight shipments into vehicle loads allows more efficient and frequent shipping by concentrating large volumes onto relatively few transportation links. This paper analyzes three schemes for routing freight shipments via consolidation terminals in an idealized many-to-many logistics network where consolidation allows carriers to take advantage of transportation economies of scale. Average transportation costs are formulated for each scheme. The minimum cost routing for a shipment is shown to be a combination of two simpler routing schemes that minimize different components of the transportation distance. Optimal terminal locations are found analytically and shown to depend on the efficiency of the linehaul transportation between terminals. Transportation costs are compared and the effectiveness of each routing scheme is shown to depend on the number of consolidation terminals and the efficiency of the linehaul transportation.

AB  - AIM: Systematic exposure and isolation of the inferior laryngeal nerve in thyroid surgery is a secure method to prevent complications. The knowledge of the nerve anatomy and its anomalies is essential to reduce laryngeal nerve injuries. By a re-examination of literature we underline the importance and some particular anatomical aspects of the anomalies which, even if rare, present an incidence of about 1%. METHODS: From January 1995 to December 2002 in our hospital we performed 299 interventions for thyroid diseases: total thyroidectomy (254 cases), partial thyroidectomy (45 cases). In 2 cases we observed a high variant (type I) of non recurrent laryngeal nerve. RESULTS: The global incidence of non recurrent laryngeal nerve was 0.66% (2/299 operations) and 0.72% if we consider the explorations of the cervical right side (2/274) where this anomaly is more frequent. The incidence of nerve injuries was 2/299 (0,66%); we had no complications in the 2 cases of non recurrent nerve observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience in thyroid surgery confirms the common opinion that only the knowledge of the laryngeal nerve anatomy and the awareness of its anomalies, associated to the systematic exposure of the nerve during surgery can prevent surgical injuries.

AB  - A mathematical programming formulation is developed to determine the throughput of a freight transportation network. The impact of demand and capacity uncertainty on the throughput is systematically studied. Mathematical proofs are provided to show that accounting for capacity uncertainty by using a single-point expected value can lead to systematic overestimation of network throughput. This result is also valid for other measures, such as system capacity. Two sampling-based methodologies-independent random number and common random number-are provided to determine network design decisions in the presence of demand uncertainty. The sampling-based solution methods provide an approximate estimate of optimal solution and provide probabilistic bounds on the optimality gap. The presented methodologies are generic and can be applied even if different functional forms (nonlinear, nonconvex) are used to model various aspects of the freight transportation network. The numerical tests demonstrate that not accounting for capacity uncertainty can result in overestimation of system throughput of up to 40%. A common random number-based sampling strategy was found to significantly outperform the independent random number strategy for all the scenarios tested.

AB  - Modeling and real-time prediction of incident-induced time-varying lane traffic states, e.g., mandatory lane-changing fractions, queue lengths, and delays are vital to investigate the time-varying incident effects on traffic congestion in both the spatial and temporal domains. This paper presents a discrete-time nonlinear stochastic model to characterize the time-varying relationships of specified lane traffic states under the condition of lane-blocking incidents on surface streets. The proposed stochastic model is composed of four types of equations: (1) recursive equations, (2) measurement equations, (3) delay-aggregation equations, and (4) boundary constraints. In addition, a recursive estimation algorithm is developed for real-time prediction of the specified time-varying lane traffic states. The proposed method is tested with simulated data generated using the Paramics traffic simulator. The preliminary tests indicate the capability of the proposed method to estimate incident effects on surface street traffic congestion in real time. We also expect that this study can provide real-time incident-related traffic information with benefits both for understanding the impact of incidents on non-recurrent traffic congestion of surface streets, and for developing advanced incident-responsive traffic control and management technologies. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

transportation network and are characterized as event-driven and
asynchronous systems. Petri networks have been utilized to model these
discrete event systems; further analysis of their structure can reveal
information relevant to the concurrency, parallelism, synchronization,
and deadlock avoidance issues. The Petri-net model of a generic traffic
junction is presented, with its deadlock avoidance property proven.
These modular networks are effective in synchronizing their components
and can be used for modeling of an asynchronous large-scale
transportation system. The derived model is suitable for simulations on
a multiprocessor computer since its program execution safety is secured.

precisely locked to the timing of its features, but is otherwise
constant. Moreover, the reconstruction fidelity can be traded flexibly
for sampling rate, over a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios and
application requirements. In an experiment with wideband speech, we find

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to note the clinical features of patients with Behçet's disease who did not show recurrent episodes of eye involvement during long-term follow-up. METHODS: A retrospective review was made of 70 Japanese patients with Behçet's disease who were seen during a 23-year period from 1974 to 1996 and followed for five or more years at Okayama University Hospital. The 70 patients were divided into three groups: 36 patients with recurrent episodes of eye involvement; 13 patients with non-recurrent one-time only eye involvement; and 21 patients with no eye involvement at all during a follow-up period of five or more years. Clinical features were compared between these three groups. RESULTS: Female sex (p = 0.0263, chi-square test), young age at the onset (p = 0.0322, Kruskal-Wallis test), and genital ulceration (p = 0.0003, chi-square test) were significantly associated with the non-recurrent or no eye involvement patients. CONCLUSIONS: Female patients with onset at a young age and who show the three signs of skin lesions and oral and genital ulcerations may have non-recurrent one-time only or no eye involvement at follow-up. A better visual prognosis can be expected for these patients.

AB  - A community-based study investigating the natural history of recurrent and non-recurrent croup is described. Daily temperature data were collected during 1977-83, in order to analyse seasonal variation and the effect of atmospheric temperature on the number of croup episodes per calendar month. A case-control study of 137 cases--consisting of 75 children with recurrent croup and 45 children with non-recurrent croup--and 236 controls matched by age and sex was also conducted. It aimed to study associations between croup and other selected diseases in the patients and their families. Recurrent croup differed from non-recurrent croup in its natural history in a number of ways. There was a winter and autumn peak in the number of episodes per month. These episodes occurred on days with significantly lower maximum and minimum temperatures. Recurrent croup was significantly associated with a patient history of asthma and wheezy bronchitis and a family history of croup. In contrast, non-recurrent croup showed an autumn peak only, as well as no association with atmospheric temperature or other disease in the patients and their families. This study confirms and extends observations indicating that recurrent croup involves a persistent and inherited airways hyper-reactivity that is triggered by viral and other stimuli, including those related to temperature.

The goal was to assess the present status of Vietnamese academic libraries in Vietnam's higher education as well as national development, especially in the areas of scientific development. This study is the result of my visits to major Vietnamese academic and public libraries, a survey of several academic libraries, and discussions I had with Vietnamese library leadership, either in person or through e-mail exchanges in July and August 2003. Needless to say, this study is far from comprehensive. Nonetheless, it identifies the salient challenges facing Vietnamese academic libraries. It also contends that Vietnam will not succeed in its modernization effort, especially in developing a knowledge-based economy, unless Vietnam is ready to devote not only a vast amount of resource to modernize its academic libraries but also to radically transform its outdated its higher education's curricular, for they are intricately linked. While this study focuses on Vietnamese academic libraries, it also brings to light to a great extend the major common challenges (lack of well-trained library professionals, modern library facilities, shortage of up-to-date scientific resources, government owned and operated universities and publishing houses, censorship, outdated instructional methods, etc.) facing academic libraries in many developing countries, especially transforming socialist states. Thus this study, albeit preliminary, should be of interest to many of these countries as well.

AB  - The ability to make optimal transportation network investments decision is central to the strategic management of transportation systems. The presence of uncertainty in transportation systems presents new challenges in making optimal network investment decisions. In this paper, we develop a multi time period network design problem considering both demand uncertainty and demand elasticity. Such an approach affords the planner the flexibility to delay, change, or even abandon the future network investment. We measure the flexibility of investing over multiple time periods as compared to a single-stage network design decision. Initially, we provide a taxonomy and define many dimensions of transportation network flexibility. This is followed with the development of a flexible network design formulation (FNDP), in which the investment is staged over multiple time periods. The demand is assumed to be separable and the demand elasticity is captured using a negative exponential distribution. We develop the FNDP formulation as bilevel stochastic mathematical programming with complementarity constraints (STOCH-MPEC) in which the bi-level formulation is converted to a single level using non-linear complementarity constraints conditions for user equilibrium (UE) problem. The formulation is implemented on two test networks and the results show the benefits of FNDP over single-stage NDP-measured in terms of increase in present expected system consumer surplus (PESCS)-are in the range of 10-30%. The results clearly demonstrate that under demand uncertainty there are potential benefits of introducing flexibility in investment decisions. Finally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of FNDP with different budget values and it is observed that certain paradoxical sharp corners are observed at certain budget values. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines the problem of locating additional passenger facilities on a transportation network to supplement ones that already exist. A distinction is made between “supporting” facilities which operate only in concert with already existing ones and “new” facilities which are self-sufficient and operate independently. It is shown that, when the objective is to maximize the utility of travel times to all users, at least one set of optimal locations for the new facilities exist on the nodes of the network if the utility function for travel times is convex. This result is proven under very general conditions including the assumption of a probabilistic transportation network, i.e. a network where travel times on network branches are random variables. A straightforward algorithm for solving a specific simple case is also provided and the results are illustrated by examples.

AB  - Network Design Problem (NDP) is one of the important problems in combinatorial optimization. Among the network design problems, the Multicommodity Network Design (MCND) problem has numerous applications in transportation, logistics, telecommunication, and production systems. In general, decision making in rail freight transportation has three main levels: strategic, tactical, and operational. In the field of rail freight transportation planning, MCND occurs in all levels of decision making such as car blocking, train makeup, and empty car distribution. This paper presents a review of MCND problems modeling, their applications in rail freight transportation planning, and solution methods which have been developed to solve them.

AB  - Although many of the problems that Cali is experiencing - social and human capital deterioration, a declining economy, and institutional crisis - are a reflection of Colombia s complicated socioeconomic situation, the city has been hit harder by the crisis than other large cities, as confirmed by the following indicators: GDP, unemployment, poverty rate, inequality, and number of homicides. According to recent estimates, the population in Cali reached the 2 million level in 1999, making the city the second largest in the country after Bogota. Internal migration increased significantly during the early 90s due to the economic boom generated by drug dealing activities, and continued in the last part of the decade, due to resettlement movements of large population groups, affected by social conflict in rural areas. However, migration flows have generated social tension in the city, as economic opportunities became scarce. The Bank engaged in a participatory process to produce a City Development Strategy (CDS), whose specific objectives are to help the city administration and stakeholders identify a strategy to overcome the current crisis, and, be a neutral facilitator in the reconstruction process. The CDS is being developed in four stages: 1) identification of the main problems; 2) development of the analytical framework; 3) dissemination of results; and, 4) development of a financial plan.

AB  - A bilevel formulation is developed to identify vulnerable transportation\nnetwork links. The problem can be viewed as a game between an ``evil\nentity{''} and the traffic management agency. At the lower level, the\ntraffic management agency routes vehicles according to the system of\noptimal traffic assignment. At the upper level, the evil entity seeks to\nmaximize disruption to the network. A key component of this formulation\nis the vulnerability index, which is a measure of the importance of a\nspecific link to the connectivity of an origin-destination pair. The\nvulnerability index accounts for the availability of alternate paths,\nexcess capacity, and travel time. The vulnerability indices are\naggregated across all origin-destination pairs into the disruption\nindex. This disruption index is the measure of damage to the network by\nwhich the evil entity might rank links as targets. Because the evil\nentity has a limited amount of resources, it cannot strike all of the\npotential targets and must choose among subsets of links. Four cases\nwith different types of information availability for the evil entity and\nthe traffic management agency are examined for a simple network. In each\ncase, the evil entity is assumed to aim its strike at the link that has\nthe potential to carry traffic for the most origin-destination pairs.

AB  - The structure and layout of an urban transportation network have decisive effects on urban logistics operation efficiency. The traditional optimization models for an urban road transportation network usually focuses on the urban passenger-traffic efficiency maximization, but have not considered the urban road transportation network influencing the urban logistics system. Considering the urban logistics system optimization, the authors proposed optimization methods for an urban road transportation network based on logistics system operation efficiency, and they put forward the Bi-level programming models to solve the multi-objective urban transportation network optimization question. We take the urban road transportation network programming question as the upper-level model, while taking the user equilibrium model for the single logistics activity route choice as the lower-level model. Then the authors introduce the Genetic-Simulated annealing algorithms to solve the proposed model. © ASCE.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to present our experience of dealing with patients with phyllodes tumours (PT) and to correlate the risk of local recurrence with different clinicopathological factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 25 women with PT, who were managed at our centre between 1991 and 2005. All the available clinical, operative and histological details were retrieved. The median follow-up period was 4 years (range, 1-9 years). Various clinicopathological features were compared between patients who suffered from recurrent tumours to those not experiencing any recurrence. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 45 ?? 7 years and the mean duration of symptoms was 30 ?? 10 months. The mean tumour diameter was 10.5 ?? 5 cm. Preoperative diagnosis with fine needle aspiration cytology could be made in 72% of cases. Overall, 39 surgical procedures were performed (14 of which were performed for recurrences). The histology report was benign, borderline and malignant PT in 28%, 20% and 52% of cases respectively. Recurrent tumours were observed in 36% of patients and 16% experienced more than one recurrence. Two patients with malignant PT developed metastases in the follow-up period, and one of them died. Except for the extent of primary surgery, there were no significant differences in other clinicopathological factors between the recurrent and non-recurrent groups. Patients who had wide local excision (WLE) and procedures of greater magnitudes as primary procedures did not experience recurrence (p- 0.008). However, when WLE was performed for recurrent tumours, 50% of patients suffered from recurrence. CONCLUSION: WLE seems to be the initial procedure of choice for all PTs, and mastectomy for recurrent tumours. Further studies are needed to define the role of adjuvant therapies. ?? 2009 Elsevier.

AB  - In this work we consider the following hazmat transportation network design problem. A given set of hazmat shipments has to be shipped over a road transportation network in order to transport a given amount of hazardous materials from specific origin points to specific destination points, and we assume there are regional and local government authorities that want to regulate the hazmat transportations by imposing restrictions on the amount of hazmat traffic over the network links. In particular, the regional authority aims to minimize the total transport risk induced over the entire region in which the transportation network is embedded, while local authorities want the risk over their local jurisdictions to be the lowest possible, forcing the regional authority to assure also risk equity. We provide a linear bilevel programming formulation for this hazmat transportation network design problem that takes into account both total risk minimization and risk equity. We transform the bilevel model into a single-level mixed integer linear program by replacing the second level (follower) problem by its KKT conditions and by linearizing the complementary constraints, and then we solve the MIP problem with a commercial optimization solver. The optimal solution may not be stable, and we provide an approach for testing its stability and for evaluating the range of its solution values when it is not stable. Moreover, since the bilevel model is difficult to be solved optimally and its optimal solution may not be stable, we provide a heuristic algorithm for the bilevel model able to always find a stable solution. The proposed bilevel model and heuristic algorithm are experimented on real scenarios of an Italian regional network. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of determining optimal paths for routing an undesirable vehicle on a network embedded on an Euclidean plane. A typical application is the transporting of hazardous materials. Demand points, or population centers, are discretely distributed at nodes and continuously distributed on straight-line links of the network. The objective is to find, without incorporating the probability of accidental leakage of hazardous material, a path that minimizes the weighted sum of lengths over which this vehicle is within a threshold distance λ of population centers. By appropriately redefining link lengths, we can use a shortest-path algorithm to solve the problem. Special properties of the objective function allow us to efficiently calculate the modified link lengths. We discuss the properties of the optimal routing strategy and the objective value, and offer an economic interpretation of the case when λ varies. Operating within the framework of risk analysis, we integrate the probability of accidental release of hazardous material into our basic model. The routing objective becomes the minimization of expected damage, where accidental leakage of hazardous materials can inflict damage within a neighborhood λ of the accident site. We also discuss our computational experience in using the model.

AB  - Should we invest in all the transportation projects with positive net present value (NPV)? This paper builds upon a model to assist the social planner to optimally invest on the growth of the transportation network and demonstrates the answer to this question is no. The initial model, based on the Williams’ model (1) is an extension of the real option theory to the investment in transportation projects. Subject to technical, social and environmental limitations, which lead to a certain level of quality, the social planner may determine both the date and the capacity at which to improve the transportation network. The value of development of transportation projects as real options is based on the stochastic processes for the social operating revenues (including externalities) and the construction costs. After this, the initial model is modified by defining a generalized diffusion process for the state variable “ratio of social operating revenues over construction costs” that accounts for mean-reversion. The improved model allows the process of the only state variable to describe real transportation finance cases much better than the initial model because its drift is not constant but reverting to the mean of the process. Closed form analytic solutions for both the initial and the improved models are found and discussed.

AB  - A major problem addressed during the preparation of spatial development plans relates to the accessibility to facilities where services of general interest such as education, health care, public safety, and justice are offered to the population. In this context, planners typically aim at redefining the level of hierarchy to assign to the urban centers of the region under study (with a class of facilities associated with each level of hierarchy) and redesigning the region's transportation network. Traditionally, these two subjects - urban hierarchy and transportation network planning - have been addressed separately in the scientific literature. This paper presents an optimization model that simultaneously determines which urban centers and which network links should be promoted to a new level of hierarchy so as to maximize accessibility to all classes of facilities. The possible usefulness of the model for solving real-world problems of integrated urban hierarchy and transportation network planning is illustrated through an application to the Centro Region of Portugal.

AB  - When evaluating the earthquake risk to transportation system it is important to take into account the integrated effect of ground motion, liquefaction, and landslides on the network components and system. In this article, the risk from earthquakes to a transportation system is evaluated in terms of direct loss from damage to bridges and travel delays in the transportation network. The contribution of site effects to the loss from damage to bridges is estimated using the San Francisco Bay area as a test bed. Damage and loss to bridges from ground shaking and ground displacements (vertical and horizontal) from liquefaction and landslides are computed for a magnitude 7.0 scenario earthquake on the Hayward fault in California. It is found that liquefaction damage is the largest contributor to the repair cost which is used as a measure of the loss from damage. The performance of the transportation network is evaluated in terms of travel delay times. Travel delays resulting from damage due to ground shaking and changes in travel times are evaluated for the scenario event under the assumptions of fixed and variable travel demands. It is found that with fixed travel demand, the post-event travel times increase significantly. Travel times remain relatively unchanged and decrease with the variable demand time assumption.

AB  - The term ‘sustainable transportation development’ is a combination of sustainable development and transportation. As a concept, it involves the application of the sustainable development idea to transportation systems. This paper deals with how the concept of sustainability is currently used and how it should be used in the future engineering of transportation systems. First, the current definitions of sustainable development are reviewed and it is shown that there is a need for definition and criteria that can be used by engineers for planning, design and operation of transportation systems. Second, the current approaches of sustainability in transportation planning are reviewed and discussed. Subsequently, it is proposed that the focus should be on a sustainably developed transportation system, i.e. a system that meets the people’s needs, with the available or affordable environmental, financial and social resources. Finally, it is shown that a sustainably developed transportation problem is basically a mathematical problem. Keywords Sustainable development, transportation engineering, optimisation problem Introduction There appears to be a consensus of opinion that the current pattern of transportation growth is not desirable. The reader will agree that the rate of the world’s motor vehicle fleet growth, in the developed as well as in the developing world, is threatening our human, social and economic well being. Quality of life, levels of basic freedom, health, education, access to – and distribution of – resources, etc.are in danger. Reasons for this are inter alia the environmental and safety impacts of transportation, and the dependence of land uses on the financial resources for construction and maintenance of its associated infrastructure both in the short- and long-term. Sustainable development has been the topic of many conferences and activities by transportation professionals and international agencies. Despite the attention given, the concept still lacks clarity for certain groups of stakeholders, for example transportation engineers and planners. This paper deals with how the sustainability concept is currently used in transportation engineering and planning, and how it should be rationalised in the future for the planning, design and operation of transportation systems.

AB  - This report describes and, where possible, quantifies the value of information and information services for transportation agencies. It evaluates the various means of accessing information and looks at the important role of the information professional. In 1994, the Transportation Research Board Committee A5001 on the Conduct of Research addressed the need to improve recognition of the value of information, information services, and information professionals. As a result, the Federal Highway Administration initiated a project overseen by a panel of technical experts to 1) determine the value of information and information services and 2) identify strategies for promoting information programs (included in this report as an appendix). This report documents how information services help transportation agencies operate more efficiently and effectively. Based on an extensive literature search and interviews with public- and private-sector experts, it shows that the value of information can be measured in terms of: 1) reduced costs of agency research, technology development, and operations; 2) quicker implementation of innovations and time savings, and 3) more effective decision making at all levels of the agency. The support of top management is also an indicator of the value information and information services hold within an organization. This report documents that information services are of significant value to transportation agencies. It also identifies a number of areas where existing programs and resources need to be strengthened. Recommendations for the Federal Highway Administration and its partners include: Taking the lead in building consensus on information issues and developing a national transportation information policy, Developing a national marketing action plan to raise awareness of the value of information, educate management on the need for information services, and promote information programs in transportation agencies, and Developing a comprehensive inventory of all transportation information resources and programs available nationwide.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The outcome and prognosis of ovarian cancer is highly variable. The objective of this study was to compare survival and clinicopathological prognostic factors with the expression levels of two matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and fibronectin as tumor invasion and metastasis markers in ovarian cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Histologically-verified epithelial ovarian tumours from 27 patients were studied. The latent and the activated forms of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were measured as gelatinase activity from tumour extracts and from serum and ascites samples by a zymographic technique. The fibronectin content was quantified by immunoblotting and densitometric analysis. Molecular marker levels were correlated to clinicopathological parameters such as survival and disease recurrence during the median postoperative follow-up period of 30 months. RESULTS: The levels of MMP-9 and fibronectin, but not those of MMP-2, were significantly higher in tumour tissues and in the ascites fluid of the recurrent patient group and the patient group who did not survive, as compared to the non-reccurent cases. CONCLUSION: Our data support that high expression of MMP-9 and fibronectin indicate poor prognosis for ovarian cancer patients who have similar clinicopathological prognostic factors.

AB  - GM production is up, but that doesn't mean Latin Americans like or want it, say Luisa Massarani, Ildeu de Castro Moreira and  Ana Maria Vara*.\n\nA report launched by the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications (ISAAA) in March 2010 paints a rosy picture of small-scale farmers embracing — and benefitting from — genetic modification (GM) technology at a rapid pace (see GM crops flourishing in developing world, says report).\n\nBut recent research from China shows that wide planting of GM cotton has caused a surge in pests (see Bt cotton linked with surge in crop pest).\n\nOur experience in Brazil and Argentina — both among the world's top producers of GM crops — similarly indicates that growth in GM crop production has guaranteed neither wide-scale social acceptance of the technology nor benefits for small-scale farmers.\n\nEarly acclaim\n\nIt is true that when, in the late 1990s, international agribusiness Monsanto introduced Argentina to Roundup Ready soya (a crop designed to tolerate the herbicide glyphosate), politicians and many commercialfarmers welcomed it with open arms.\n\nVery early on, multinational corporations and farmers' associations began an intense promotional campaign for GM crops, trading on the country's view of itself as a leading grain producer.\n\nJust one government office was responsible for GM crops, and this helped ensure the legal system didn't pose any obstacles. In fact, the issue of GM food was never really put up for public debate.\n\nAnd Monsanto's GM soya arrived in Argentina when the country was entering a major economic crisis, and agricultural income was badly needed.\n\nThere were other favourable economic factors too. Monsanto didn't have a monopoly over the technology because it could not patent its Roundup Ready soya in Argentina. Also, glyphosate was no longer under patent; field machinery was easily accessible under contract; and to GM needed less field labour compared with non-GM soya.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, GM soya was highly profitable, especially when combined with non-till practices and an increase in agro-chemical use. All these factors contributed GM soya's rapid penetration into Argentinean agriculture.\n\nBut our interviews and focus groups with about 50 Argentinean small-scale farmers in 2007revealed concern about the social changes the switch to GM soya causes. GM profits for many came not from growing the crop themselves, but from renting their land to commercial farmers for large-scale production.\n\nThis threatens sustainability because it increases small-scale farmers' reliance on external parties for their income, and can also mean both agricultural skills and land fertility are lost.\n\nBattle for Brazil\n\nIn Brazil, the opposition to GM crops has been much more overt, with Monsanto's move to introduce Roundup Ready soya sparking almost a decade of controversies and legal disputes.\n\nAs early as 1998the Worker's Party — the main opposition party at the time— adopted an anti-GM stance. Some state governments too, for example in Rio Grande do Sul and Paraná, ideologically opposed GM crops and even implemented local legislation to prohibit them.\n\nEnvironmental groupsand social movements, such as Greenpeace and the Movement of the Landless Rural Workers, also took up anti-GM positions and were much more vocal and active in campaigning against GM crops than their Argentinean counterparts.\n\nAnd if political divisions have characterised the GM debate in Brazil, so too have divisions within the scientific community.\n\nThe community generally supported research into GM crops. The Brazilian Academy of Science also supported growing them. But several prominent scientists, including Glaci Zancan, then president of the Brazilian Association for the Advancement of Science, opposed commercial GM crops in the absence of long-term studies on health and environmental impacts.  \n\nOvercoming opposition\n\nDespite the controversy and criticism, GM crop cultivation has expanded rapidly in Brazil, even before it was legally approved in 2005. Our focus groups and individual interviews with about 80 Brazilian stakeholders and approximately 200 small-scale farmers reveal many reasons for this growth.\n\nThey include the use of non-approved GM seeds illegally brought over from Argentina; a curiosity for testing new seeds; pressures to keep the harvest as economically productive as possible; and the fact that, in some regions, conventional soya seeds are becoming hard to find.\n\nBut more important than these factors has been the clever tactics employed by the pro-GM lobby, which even include — according to some of our interviewees — doling out free GM seeds.\n\nThe most significant move was the tactic that got GM soya legalised in 2005. The pro-GM lobby got the issue of stem cell research onto the same bill as GM soya — the biosafety law. This move capitalised on the much broader support among politicians, scientists and the public for stem cell research.\n\nThe strategy worked — the bill was passed by parliament by 352 votes to 60, and officially enabled the production and sale of GM soya in Brazil.\n\nBut the debate is far from over. There are still strong tensions around GM within government, and small-scale farmers remain unconvinced. Our research found a strong demand for unbiased information on GM crops and three national surveys also found a lack of acceptance of GM crops, even among farmers growing GM soya. Indeed, a common refrain among those we interviewed was "I'm happy to grow it, but I wouldn't eat it".\n\nIn Latin America, as in many developing regions of the world, the GM debate is 'messy'. There is a danger in interpreting a simple increase in GM crop cultivation as a sign that countries are wholeheartedly in favour of the technology, or that acceptance and benefits are widespread.\n\nLuisa Massarani is Latin America and Caribbean coordinator for SciDev.Net and researcher at Museum of Life, House of Oswaldo Cruz, Fiocruz, Brazil.\n\nIldeu de Castro Moreira is a professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\nAna Maria Vara is a researcher at the National University of San Martín, Argentina.\n\n*The authors thank Carla Almeida and Fabio Gouveia for their contributions to both this article and the research project it mentions, which was supported by the International Development Research Centre

AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum bilirubin may have potent antioxidant and cytoprotective effects. Serum bilirubin levels are inversely associated with several cardiovascular and metabolic endpoints, but their association with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has not been investigated except for a single cross-sectional study in a pediatric population. We assessed the prospective association between serum bilirubin concentrations (total, direct, and indirect) and the risk for NAFLD.\n\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a cohort study in 5,900 Korean men, 30 to 59 years of age, with no evidence of liver disease and no major risk factors for liver disease at baseline. Study participants were followed in annual or biennial health examinations between 2002 and 2009. The presence of fatty liver was determined at each visit by ultrasonography. We observed 1,938 incident cases of NAFLD during 28,101.8 person-years of follow-up. Increasing levels of serum direct bilirubin were progressively associated with a decreasing incidence of NAFLD. In age-adjusted models, the hazard ratio for NAFLD comparing the highest to the lowest quartile of serum direct bilirubin levels was 0.61 (95% CI 0.54-0.68). The association persisted after adjusting for multiple metabolic parameters (hazard ratio comparing the highest to the lowest quartile 0.86, 95% CI 0.76-0.98; P trend = 0.039). Neither serum total nor indirect bilirubin levels were significantly associated with the incidence of NAFLD.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective study, higher serum direct bilirubin levels were significantly associated with a lower risk of developing NAFLD, even adjusting for a variety of metabolic parameters. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this association and to establish the role of serum direct bilirubin as a marker for NAFLD risk.

AB  -  Transportation and logistics are a major sector of the economy, however data analysis in this domain has remained largely in the province of optimization. The potential of data mining and knowledge discovery techniques is largely untapped. Transportation networks are naturally represented as graphs. This paper explores the problems in mining of transportation network graphs: we hope to find how current techniques both succeed and fail on this problem, and from the failures, we hope to present new challenges for data mining. Experimental results from applying both existing graph mining and conventional data mining techniques to real transportation network data are provided, including new approaches to making these techniques applicable to the problems. Reasons why these techniques are not appropriate are discussed. We also suggest several challenging problems to precipitate research and galvanize future work in this area.

AB  - As urbanization increases and new business models for transportation and mobility arise, the design of transportation networks should no longer be done in a vacuum. Design interactions between multiple networks have largely been analyzed either as non-cooperative games with non-unique Nash equilibria, even if assumptions needed for such games are not satisfied, or using knowledge-based or agent-based methods that cannot explicitly quantify network sensitivities. A new framework is proposed to model network design in the presence of coexisting networks using multiobjective optimization in a novel manner to identify symbiotic relationships. The framework does not require strict assumptions about availability of information or timing of decisions, and it can be used to examine network sensitivities that knowledge-based methods cannot. A bundled discount pricing problem and subsidy problem are derived from the symbiotic relationships. The framework is applied to formulate a symbiotic bike-sharing network design problem in the presence of a coexisting transit system as a departure-time-elastic multicommodity flow problem. A small network example demonstrates the potential dependency between transit systems and bike-sharing systems for the first time, and the existence of an optimal discount value for considering bundled fares. A larger bike-sharing network, BIXI, is examined in the presence of the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) in downtown Toronto to address the question of subsidy. It is found that BIXI is operating in a relatively transit-friendly state, and subsidy by TTC to maintain a status quo in Toronto may be worth considering if the cost of subsidy is less than a conservative average reduction achieved of 2.43 units of transit-only user cost for every 1 unit increase of bike-sharing cost. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper investigates clinical significance of non-recurrent laryngeal nerve during thyroid surgery. Clinical data from 5 cases of non-recurrent laryngeal nerve and related literature reviews were made to acknowledge its incidence, variant types and matters concerned during thyroid operations. CASE REPORT: 821 recurrent laryngeal nerves were anatomized during 2496 thyroid operations, from which 5 were confirmed to hold non-recurrent laryngeal nerves (0.61%). 3 patients were found to have non-recurrent laryngeal nerves during re-operation because of voice horse after the first operation which improved much after re-operation. The other two patients were recognized during the first operation. All 5 cases were not diagnosed preoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Non-recurrent laryngeal nerve, a rare anomaly, is very vulnerable during thyroid surgery. It is helpful to avoid injuring non-recurrent laryngeal nerve that identification of the non-recurrent laryngeal nerve and its types.

AB  - The path length and number of turns are the major factors in path planning of transportation and navigation systems. Shortest path planning has been widely studied in the literatures. Most researches only take the issue of shortest distance into account, and the impact of turns are rarely mentioned, that is, the shortest path may not be the fastest. Considering both two factors in a path-searching algorithm is NP-complete. This paper proposes two algorithms: the least-turn path algorithm and the minimum-cost path algorithm to balance both the path length and turns. The proposed algorithms adapt Lee's rectilinear routing algorithm to find a least-turn path with turn penalty on a mesh-connected network. In addition, Kirby's concept and a modified Dijkstra's algorithm are also introduced for the proposed minimum-cost path algorithm, which considers the turn penalty and the length factor on a transportation network. The time complexities for both algorithms are O(N), where N is the number of nodes on a mesh-connected network or the intersections on a transportation network.

AB  - This paper analyses the potential of advanced traveller information systems (ATIS) in a road network in which incidents are generated in a random fashion. A simulation model is applied in which the traffic flows are the aggregation of drivers’ decisions. These decisions, in turn, are modelled using boundedly rational principles. The experiments performed focus on the relationship between the network wide performance, the level of market penetration, the quality of the information, and the en route switching propensity. The results indicate that if drivers behave according to boundedly rational principles without being provided with information in a road network with non-recurrent congestion, the road network will not be used efficiently in terms of travel time. In these circumstances, ATIS is useful. However, the commercial viability of ATIS might be frustrated by the quickly diminishing addi- tional benefits to equipped drivers. Further, the complexity of the implications of ATIS is stressed by the strong interaction between, on the one hand, the level of market penetration, the quality of the information and the en route switching propensity and, on the other hand, the network wide performance.

Finally, we compare the algorithm with other incident detection algorithms on the detection rate, false alarm rate and mean detection time. A simulation result shows the algorithm proposed has higher detection rate, lower false alarm rate and longer mean time detection. Furthermore, we state the direction of our next study.

AB  - This paper presents a multi-modal freight transportation model based on a digitized geographic network. A systematic analysis and decomposition of all the transport operations, i.e. moving, loading and unloading, transshipping and transiting, leads to the development of a virtual network where each virtual link corresponds to a specific operation, and all transportation modes and means are inter-linked. Software, called NODUS, automatically generates the virtual network so that the model can be conveniently applied to large networks. The analytical structure of the links notation makes it easy to attach specific cost functions to each virtual link. The model is applied to the trans-European freight network of roads, railways and inland waterways for the transportation of wood. Cost functions are built up for each operation by each mode/means combination. A detailed point-to-point origin-destination matrix, calibrated on Eurostat statistics, is generated by a Monte-Carlo technique. Then, the total transportation cost is minimized with respect to the choices of routes, modes and means. This provides estimations of transportation services demands as well as modal splits, to the extent that the two hypotheses of demand based on generalized cost minimization and market contestability are accepted. A sensitivity analysis on the relative road cost is made, which provides measures of arc-elasticities. Copyright ?? 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - In just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing environments, on-time delivery is a key performance measure for dispatching and routing of freight vehicles. Growing travel time delays and variability, attributable to increasing congestion in transportation networks, are greatly impacting the efficiency of JIT logistics operations. Recurrent and non-recurrent congestion are the two primary reasons for delivery delay and variability. Over 50% of all travel time delays are attributable to non-recurrent congestion sources such as incidents. Despite its importance, state-of-the-art dynamic routing algorithms assume away the effect of these incidents on travel time. In this study, we propose a stochastic dynamic programming formulation for dynamic routing of vehicles in non-stationary stochastic networks subject to both recurrent and non-recurrent congestion. We also propose alternative models to estimate incident induced delays that can be integrated with dynamic routing algorithms. Proposed dynamic routing models exploit real-time traffic information regarding speeds and incidents from Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) sources to improve delivery performance. Results are very promising when the algorithms are tested in a simulated network of South-East Michigan freeways using historical data from the MITS Center and Traffic.com. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A cost-efficient network-on-chip is needed in a scalable many-core systems. Recent multicore processors have leveraged a ring topology and hierarchical ring can increase scalability but presents different challenges, including higher hop count and global ring bottleneck. In this work, we describe a hierarchical ring topology that we refer to as a transportation-network-inspired network-on-chip (tNoC) that leverages principles from transportation network systems. In particular, we propose a novel hybrid flow control for hierarchical ring topology to scale the topology efficiently. The flow control is hybrid in that the channels are allocated on flit granularity while the buffers are allocated on packet granularity. The hybrid flow control enables a simplified router microarchitecture (to minimize per-hop latency) as router input buffers are minimized and buffers are pushed to the edges, either at the output ports or at the hub routers that interconnect the local rings to the global ring - while still supporting virtual channels to avoid protocol deadlock. We also describe a packet-quota-system (PQS) and a separate credit network that provide congestion management, support prioritized arbitration in the network, and provide support for multiflit packets. A detailed evaluation of a 64-core CMP shows that the tNoC improves performance by up to 21% compared with a baseline, buffered hierarchical ring topology while reducing NoC energy by 51%.

AB  - This paper presents an autonomic architecture for real-time traffic network management. Following this architecture, local controllers are assumed to share information on the traffic pattern as well as traffic control actions in their vicinities. These controllers could be dynamically configured to operate either individually or in teams to develop integrated control strategies that best cope with the observed traffic pattern in the network. An off-line testing of the proposed architecture is conducted through investigating the most efficient team-formation strategies among controllers to mitigate a non-recurrent traffic congestion situation in a hypothetical transportation network. The network performance under different team configurations is compared using a network traffic simulation model. The results illustrate that more efficient routing could be obtained through collaboration among individual controllers, which result in considerable travel time savings during the incident.

According to recent estimates, the population in Cali reached the 2 million level in 1999, making the city the second largest in the country after Bogota. Internal migration increased significantly during the early 90s due to the economic boom generated by drug dealing activities, and continued in the last part of the decade, due to resettlement movements of large population groups, affected by social conflict in rural areas. However, migration flows have generated social tension in the city, as economic opportunities became scarce. The Bank engaged in a participatory process to produce a City Development Strategy (CDS), whose specific objectives are to help the city administration and stakeholders identify a strategy to overcome the current crisis, and, be a neutral facilitator in the reconstruction process.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of finding a quickest path between two points in the Euclidean plane in the presence of a transportation network. A transportation network consists of a planar network where each road (edge) has an individual speed. A traveller may enter and exit the network at any point on the roads. Along any road the traveller moves with a fixed speed depending on the road, and outside the network the traveller moves at unit speed in any direction. We give an exact algorithm for the basic version of the problem: given a transportation network of total complexity n in the Euclidean plane, a source point s and a destination point t, and the quickest path between s and t. We also show how the transportation network can be preprocessed in time O(n^2 log n) into a data structure of size O(n^2) such that (1 + \epsilon)-approximate cheapest path cost queries between any two points in the plane can be answered in time O(1\epsilon^4 log n).

AB  - Meningiomas are considered as benign neoplasms affecting the coverings of the central nervous system and compromise approximately 20% of all intracranial tumours. However, a number of these tumours recur even after total resection. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prognostic significance for recurrence of the human telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) in the cells of meningiomas. The expression of hTERT-protein can be evaluated by immunohistochemical staining using a monoclonal antibody against hTERT (clone 44F42, NCL-L-hTERT). The interdependence between tumour recurrence and cell proliferation in this study is analysed by Ki-67 immunoreactivity (clone MIB-1). Archival material from 29 non-recurrent and 32 recurrent tumours has been evaluated, including specimens from World Health Organization (WHO) stages I (n = 73), II (n = 2) and III (n = 12). Although the tumours were categorized as benign meningiomas following the WHO classification, recurrence in 22 of 50 cases did not correlate with the tumour stage. For hTERT staining, the following results were found for nucleolar and total nuclear staining, respectively: non-recurrent meningiomas, 2.9% (+/- 7.7) and 3.0% (+/- 8.0); recurrent meningiomas at first resection, 16.8% (+/- 19.7) and 31.6% (+/- 30.2). Concerning the Ki-67 labelling index (LI): for the group of non-recurrent meningiomas, results were 2.1% (+/- 1.7) and for the recurrent group at first resection, 1.7% (+/- 2.0). A significant difference was seen for the hTERT staining (P < 0.001) between the non-recurrent and recurrent meningiomas, whereas no statistical significance was found for Ki-67. In conclusion hTERT-positive meningiomas had a high incidence for recurrence. Ki-67 was a good marker of cell proliferation status of the tumours, but did not correlate with recurrence; thus, hTERT alone seemed to be a potential predictor for recurrence.

AB  - Introduction: A non-recurrent variant of the inferior laryngeal nerve has been seldom reported. These reports are mostly based on cadaveric dissection studies or large chart review studies in which the emphasis is placed on the determination of the frequency of the variation, and not on the clinical appearance of this variant. We graphically describe the intraoperative identification of a non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve. Case Presentation: A 44-year old Caucasian man was referred to the Head and Neck Surgery Outpatient Clinic with the diagnosis of a nodular mass in his left thyroid lobe that had been growing for one year. A fine needle aspiration puncture was compatible with thyroid papillary cancer. It was decided that the patient should undergo total thyroidectomy. During surgery, a non-recurrent right inferior laryngeal nerve was noted. This nerve emanated from the right vagus nerve, entering the larynx 3 cm after its origin. The nerve did not show a recurrent course. The nerve on the left side had a normal configuration. The surgery and post-operative period were uneventful, and the patient had no change in his voice. Conclusion: This paper allows those interested to become acquainted with the normal intraoperative appearance of a non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve. This will undoubtedly be of significance for all of those performing invasive diagnostic and surgical procedures in the neck and upper thoracic regions, in order to minimize the risk of iatrogenic injury to this nerve. This is of extreme importance, since a unilateral lesion of this nerve may result in permanent hoarseness, and a bilateral lesion may lead to aphonia and life-threatening dyspnea.

AB  - In the first part of this paper, the framework of the Dutch Integral Transportation Study is given. and the position of the defining of the road network is pointed out. In the second part, the transport network optimization problem is stated formally and the algorithm devised to solve this problem is described. The problem is formed by the minimization of the total costs (investments and users costs) for the transport of a given tripmatrix by choice of the dimensions and flows of the links of a transport network. The solution method has been devised especially in order to overcome the computational dificulties at large networks. It gives a reasonable solution in a relatively very short computation time. To that end the problem is decomposed into a number of sub-problems. yielding the optimal relationship between the dimension and the traffic flow for each link. and a master problem assigning the flows to the network in such a way that the objective function is minimized. In the third part the application of this method to the optimization of the Dutch road network is described.

AB  - This work builds further on the Orbital Transportation Network Analysis methodology proposed by the authors in earlier research. Through a review of the literature of flexibility, the different types of flexibility that can apply to an orbital transportation network, and their relationships to the system architecture, are explored. Finally a provider- side flexibility metric is defined as a combination of the different types of flexibilities. The resulting metric can then be used in addition to performance and value metrics to rank the best architectures for the orbital transportation network. It is argued that service flexibility for an orbital transportation network can be defined as the combination of three types of flexibilities, which play out in different time frames: Mix flexibility (long-term), Volume flexibility (mid-term), and emergency service flexibility (short term). Using these definitions, different architectures for an orbital transportation network were evaluated on the basis of their flexibility, value, and performance metrics.

AB  - This paper presents direct and cross-elasticity estimates of the demands for three freight transportation modes: rail, road and inland waterways. They are computed for 10 different categories of goods with a detailed multimodal network model of Belgian freight transports. The model, which minimises the generalised cost of transportation tasks defined by O-D matrices, assigns traffic flows to the different modes, transport means and routes. Successive simulations with different relative costs permit the computation of specific arc-elasticities.

AB  - This paper presents direct and cross-elasticity estimates of the demands for three freight transportation modes: rail, road and inland waterways. They are computed for 10 different categories of goods with a detailed multimodal network model of Belgian freight transports. The model, which minimises the generalised cost of transportation tasks defined by O-D matrices, assigns traffic flows to the different modes, transport means and routes. Successive simulations with different relative costs permit the computation of specific arc-elasticities.

AB  -  A framework is presented which may be used to analyze and evaluate intermodal networks. An intermodal network may be defined as an integrated transportation system consisting of two or more modes. Modes on intermodal networks are connected through facilities which allow travelers and/or freight to transfer from one mode to another during a trip from an origin to a destination. Network equilibrium models may be used in the transportation planning field to make predictions regarding future network activity in terms of traffic volumes and travel costs, to evaluate alternative policies and to aid the decision making process in terms of future transportation plans. To expedite and facilitate the effort of detailed intermodal network representation and analysis, a network equilibrium model is interfaced with a geographic information system (GIS). This interface takes advantage of new technologies and sources of information on the physical components of the network. It allows the user to store the results of the proposed models in a GIS environment and display them in a spatial data format.

AB  - Network Design Problem (NDP) is one of the important problems in combinatorial optimization. Among the network design problems, the Multicommodity Network Design (MCND) problem has numerous applications in transportation, logistics, telecommunication, and production systems. In general, decision making in rail freight transportation has three main levels: strategic, tactical, and operational. In the field of rail freight transportation planning, MCND occurs in all levels of decision making such as car blocking, train makeup, and empty car distribution. This paper presents a review of MCND problems modeling, their applications in rail freight transportation planning, and solution methods which have been developed to solve them.

AB  - This paper investigates geometric and algorithmic properties of the Voronoi diagram for a transportation network on the Euclidean plane. In the presence of a transportation network, the distance is measured as the length of the shortest (time) path. In doing so, we introduce a needle, a generalized Voronoi site. We present an O(nm2 + m3 + nm log n) algorithm to compute the Voronoi diagram for a transportation network on the Euclidean plane, where n is the number of given sites and m is the complexity of the given transportation network. Moreover, in the case that the roads in a transportation network have only a constant number of directions and speeds, we propose two algorithms; one needs O(nm + m2 + n log n) time with O(m(n + m)) space and the other O(nm log n + m2 log m) time with O(n + m) space. © World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - In transportation studies, global consensus has been reached that railways should replace road transportation in the freight market on a large-scale if the greenhouse effect is to be reduced in the forthcoming decades. However, we know relatively little about the current efficiency situation in railway freight on a global scale and whether it has been able to improve its performance during recent decades. This research uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) to reveal efficiency development in this sector. Research results show that certain countries/regions, like North America, China, Russia, Israel and Baltic States, are showing impressive frontier performance, but the railway freight sector has not been able to improve its efficiency performance during the past decades and efficiency is mostly confined to a small number of countries.

AB  - The ability to make optimal transportation network investments decision is central to the strategic management of transportation systems. The presence of uncertainty in transportation systems presents new challenges in making optimal network investment decisions. In this paper, we develop a multi time period network design problem considering both demand uncertainty and demand elasticity. Such an approach affords the planner the flexibility to delay, change, or even abandon the future network investment. We measure the flexibility of investing over multiple time periods as compared to a single-stage network design decision. Initially, we provide a taxonomy and define many dimensions of transportation network flexibility. This is followed with the development of a flexible network design formulation (FNDP), in which the investment is staged over multiple time periods. The demand is assumed to be separable and the demand elasticity is captured using a negative exponential distribution. We develop the FNDP formulation as bilevel stochastic mathematical programming with complementarity constraints (STOCH-MPEC) in which the bi-level formulation is converted to a single level using non-linear complementarity constraints conditions for user equilibrium (UE) problem. The formulation is implemented on two test networks and the results show the benefits of FNDP over single-stage NDP-measured in terms of increase in present expected system consumer surplus (PESCS)-are in the range of 10-30%. The results clearly demonstrate that under demand uncertainty there are potential benefits of introducing flexibility in investment decisions. Finally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of FNDP with different budget values and it is observed that certain paradoxical sharp corners are observed at certain budget values. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Traffic congestion in an urban arterial causes delays and extra travel time when the signal control systems are incapable of responding to traffic fluctuations. Pre-timed signal systems and actuated controllers cannot accommodate these types of traffic variation, due to a fixed signal plan. The objective of this research is the development of a responsive signal control strategy, which responds to varying traffic demand that arises from recurrent and non-recurrent traffic congestion. Case-based reasoning (CBR), a technique in artificial intelligence (AI), was used to formulate a control strategy named RESSICA ( Res ponsive Si gnal C ontrol for A rterial), which matches the traffic pattern and assigns a corresponding timing plan from its library with minimal re-computation. RESSICA was tested in a corridor network with four signalized intersections for recurrent and non-recurrent congestion, as well as during the Off-peak period. The performance of RESSICA outperformed the existing actuated signal controller, in terms of travel time, delay, stop delay and intersection delay.

AB  - Very often, recurrent neural networks are used to model dynamic,
nonlinear relationships. However, particularly in many technical
applications recurrent networks do not perform noticeably better than
static networks (like e.g. Multilayer Perceptrons) processing only the
current input pattern. The main reason for this observation is that the
networks have to cope with noisy input and sometimes even noisy output
data. Large weights in recurrent connections may cause stability
problems and with small weights temporal information cannot be
considered in an appropriate way. This paper demonstrates by means of an
application example (tool wear monitoring in turning) that in these
cases dynamic, non-recurrent paradigms like Time Delay neural networks
should be preferred. These networks use tapped delay lines (delay
elements in feedforward direction) to take past input information into
account. Due to their noise suppression capabilities dynamic,
non-recurrent networks can be superior to dynamic, recurrent paradigms
like NARX-networks. The paper presents the first use of such a
non-recurrent network in the mentioned application area and shows that
the results of a wear estimation can be improved significantly

AB  - BACKGROUND: Genomic disorders are caused by copy number changes that may exhibit recurrent breakpoints processed by nonallelic homologous recombination. However, region-specific disease-associated copy number changes have also been observed which exhibit non-recurrent breakpoints. The mechanisms underlying these non-recurrent copy number changes have not yet been fully elucidated.\n\nRESULTS: We analyze large NF1 deletions with non-recurrent breakpoints as a model to investigate the full spectrum of causative mechanisms, and observe that they are mediated by various DNA double strand break repair mechanisms, as well as aberrant replication. Further, two of the 17 NF1 deletions with non-recurrent breakpoints, identified in unrelated patients, occur in association with the concomitant insertion of SINE/variable number of tandem repeats/Alu (SVA) retrotransposons at the deletion breakpoints. The respective breakpoints are refractory to analysis by standard breakpoint-spanning PCRs and are only identified by means of optimized PCR protocols designed to amplify across GC-rich sequences. The SVA elements are integrated within SUZ12P intron 8 in both patients, and were mediated by Target-Primed Reverse Transcription of SVA mRNA intermediates derived from retrotranspositionally-active source elements. Both SVA insertions occurred during early postzygotic development and are uniquely associated with large deletions of 1 Mb and 867 kb, respectively, at the insertion sites.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Since active SVA elements are abundant in the human genome and the retrotranspositional activity of many SVA source elements is high, SVA insertion-associated large genomic deletions encompassing many hundreds of kilobases could constitute a novel and as yet under-appreciated mechanism underlying large-scale copy number changes in the human genome.

AB  - The China sustainable development is the simultaneously three key facets, including urbanism, industrialization, and information. Building a Smart Low-carbon City is an energy strategy for the sustainable development of Chinese cities. One technology way for this strategy is the City Intelligent Energy Network (CIEN), supporting a green, ecological development of the Chinese cities. CIEN starts from the redistribute of city land-use, taking small gas turbine as the major power, combining with the new energy mode, such as solar energy, wind energy and low level energy (geothermal, ice cold storage, water cold storage). CIEN could supply relatively large network and grid with electricity, heat, and cold, realizing the efficient, integrate and gradable use of the energy network technology. As CIEN is on its starting point, so this kind of technology still need the combination work with the lab research and applicable field test. Considering the city unit scale, the transportation mode, energy resources, and the traditional mode to power grid and other factors, the key point is to balance the economical use and the resource capability and adaptability. This paper tries to use the 2007 statistical data including city economy, construction, population, and different energy parameter, to establish the comprehensive model. Combining the model results, the CIEN adaptability will be discussed, and meaningful policies will be proposed, with the focusing of how to build a Smart Low-carbon city. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The results show that the distribution of the air freight network in China is imbalanced and has a very clear four hierarchy of hub-level city, regional-level city, middle-level city and edge-level city. The vast majority of air freight, routes, movements, navigable cities concentrated in a few urban and regional cities, and the freight transportation of other cities mainly depend on transfer from the central cities.

In this article, the risk from earthquakes to a transportation system is evaluated in terms of direct loss from damage to bridges and travel delays in the transportation network. The contribution of site effects to the loss from damage to bridges is estimated using the San Francisco Bay area as a test bed. Damage and loss to bridges from ground shaking and ground displacements (vertical and horizontal) from liquefaction and landslides are computed for a magnitude 7.0 scenario earthquake on the Hayward fault in California. It is found that liquefaction damage is the largest contributor to the repair cost which is used as a measure of the loss from damage. The performance of the transportation network is evaluated in terms of travel delay times. Travel delays resulting from damage due to ground shaking and changes in travel times are evaluated for the scenario event under the assumptions of fixed and variable travel demands. It is found that with fixed travel demand, the post-event travel times increase significantly. Travel times remain relatively unchanged and decrease with the variable demand time assumption.

AB  - Recurrent and non-recurrent chromosomal rearrangements seem to reflect susceptibility to DNA rearrangements due to the presence of recombinogenic motifs in at least one partner chromosomal region. While specific genomic motifs such as AT-rich repeats, fragile sites and Alu repeats are often found in recurrent translocations, the molecular mechanisms underlying non-recurrent chromosomal rearrangements remain largely unknown. Here, we map the breakpoint region of a non-recurrent translocation, t(7;9)(q11.23;p24.3), present in a healthy woman who inherited the apparently balanced translocation from her mother and transmitted the same rearrangement to two sons-respectively healthy and aborted. Characterisation by a two-step FISH analysis, first with BAC clones and then with small locus-specific probes, restricted the breakpoint intervals to 8-10 kb. Both regions contained specific Alu sequences, which, together with the flanking low copy repeat block Ac in 7q11.23, might stimulate the translocation. We noted that, although the translocation is non-recurrent, 7q11.23 is recurrently involved in different chromosomal rearrangements, supporting the hypothesis that the 7q11.23 genomic structure is prone to recombination events.

AB  - Freeway work zones with patching, paving, lane marking, debris removing, and weeding cause temporary capacity reduction in the freeway and may lead to non-recurrent traffic congestion. Such non-recurrent traffic congestion amounts to 10% of total traffic congestion in the U.S. and 31% in Germany. Non-recurrent traffic congestion has been estimated by using the capacity and the number of closed lanes in work zones and the upstream traffic demand of work zones. However, the number of the closed lanes may be insignificant due to operational strategies such as using the shoulder area and composing additional lanes by temporarily reducing the existing lane width to mitigate traffic congestion. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a method to quantify non-recurrent traffic congestion caused by freeway work zones based on traffic flow data and spatio-temporal work zone information. In addition, to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed method, a case study is conducted based on one-year historical traffic data and work zone data on major freeways in Korea. Then, multivariate statistical analysis with unobserved heterogeneity is performed to describe factors of non-recurrent traffic congestion caused by work zone activities. Due to the fact that a work zone project is usually implemented according to schedule, such negative impact as non-recurrent traffic congestion is inevitably produced. Thus, the results can be practical for the performance evaluation of congestion management programs for work zone by quantifying non-recurrent traffic congestion. Additionally, the results from the statistical analysis can be potentially useful in developing a forecasting model for providing travelers with traffic information such as an alternative route to escape non-recurrent traffic congestion by freeway work zones. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

By analyzing the constituent structure of composite network, choosing attributes and analyzing travel impedances, the composite traffic system network was established, and the traffic assignment law in the composite network was explained. Thus, a model is proposed to describe the multimodal composite transportation network. Finally, simulation process of transport planning was proposed and explained by taking Yang Hu Yuan Area planning in Changsha as an example based on TransCAD software. The results show the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed model.

AB  - Cranial nerve injury during carotid endarterectomy (CEA), while infrequent, may have serious consequences. The recurrent laryngeal nerve is one of the most commonly injured cranial nerves. Fortunately, most of these injuries are temporary. Anatomic variations in the position of cranial nerves present challenges to surgeons during CEA. Although the occurrence of a non-recurrent laryngeal nerve (NRLN) is rare, proper recognition of this anatomic variation is critical in order to minimize complications. We present a case in which a NRLN was discovered intraoperatively and carefully preserved. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of The International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery.

AB  - Having not considered such aspects as spatial distribution features of transportation networks and resident areas, the spatial influence of outside transportation modes on the features within the research regions as well as the different transit capacity of different transportation ways, the conventional measuring methods based on path analysis and network analysis are deficient to the description of regional transportation situation. With the employment and optimization of the connectivity and accessibility of the network nodes to evaluate transportation network, this study successfully breaks through the limitation of the border of investigative area and, different transportation modes can also be taken into account. Based on the gradually increased correlation coefficient between the connectivity change, which is a gradually increased process from direct connections to indirect multi-steps connections, and the development of regional economy, this paper proposes economy-network diameter index (ENDI), which is employed to evaluate the development of network and the contribution to regional economy of Gansu Province, china with the data of 2002 transportation network and the economic statistics in the Statistical Yearbook. By above methods, this empirical study comes to the following conclusions: 1) interregional transportation contributes more to the development of regional economic than that of the adjoining transportation; and 2) these indices can be used to designate spatial interactional scopes of regional economy, and accordingly to provide powerful and scientific supports for the planning of regional transportation and economy; and 3) the accessibility figure of network nodes shows that transportation of Gansu Province takes on a phenomenon of high cluster and spatial autocorrelation; and 4) ENDI can also be used to create spatial weight matrix of spatial progress. As calculation of these indices is laborious, several efficient computational methods are developed. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper we present an empirical study of the worldwide maritime transportation network (WMN) in which the nodes are ports and links are container liners connecting the ports. Using the different representations of network topology - the spaces L and P, we study the statistical properties of WMN including degree distribution, degree correlations, weight distribution, strength distribution, average shortest path length, line length distribution and centrality measures. We find that WMN is a small-world network with power law behavior. Important nodes are identified based on different centrality measures. Through analyzing weighted clustering coefficient and weighted average nearest neighbors degree, we reveal the hierarchy structure and rich-club phenomenon in the network. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background. The MONICA (Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Diseases) project in Augsburg provides the first population-based cohort study in Germany to quantify the associations of the risk factors hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and smoking with incident non-fatal and fatal myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality, and to assess their impact at the population level. Methods. The cohort comprises 1074 men and 1013 women aged 45-64 years; they were followed over 8 years from 1984-1992. In the men, there were 61 non-fatal and fatal myocardial infarctions and 92 all-cause mortality events over this period; in the women the number of deaths from all causes was 45. Incidence rates, hazard rate ratios, population attributable fractions and rate advancement periods were calculated. Results. Adjusting for confounders, the myocardial infarction hazard rate ratios for men with hypertension, or a total choleslerol/HDL-cholesterol ratio ≤ 5.5, or smoking ≤ 20 cigarettes/day, were 2.0 (95% CI 1.2-3.5), 2.9 (95% CI 1.7-5.0), and 2.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-5.0), respectively. The risk factor combination total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio ≤ 5.5 and cigarette smoking was particularly hazardous. The three risk factors contributed 65% of the burden of myocardial infarction in the population. The rate advancement period for myocardial infarction associated with hypertension, total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio ≤ 5.5 or smoking ≤ 20 cigarettes/day was 8.3, 12.4 and 11.5 years, respectively. In women, these risk factors were similarly predictive of all-cause mortality. Comparing the cohort data from Augsburg with those of two occupational cohorts from Germany reveals higher absolute myocardial infarction risks in the Augsburg population; however, the relative risk estimates in the Augsburg and the two occupational cohorts were very similar. Conclusion. Our results confirm the important contribution of the classical risk factors to the risk of myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality in Germany. The results pertaining to the concept of rate advancement periods particularly demonstrate the great potential for prevention.

AB  - U nder federal law, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) are charged with developing transportation plans and programs to accommodate mobility needs for persons and goods within their regions. To this end, the MPOs estimate future travel demand and analyze the impacts of alternative transportation investment scenarios using comput- erized travel demand forecasting models. These models are used to estimate how urban growth and proposed facilities and the associated operational investments and transportation policies will affect mobility and the opera- tion of the transportation system. Forecasts derived from these models enable policy makers to make informed decisions on investments and poli- cies relating to the transportation system. In addition, MPOs in federally designated air quality nonattainment or maintenance areas have been given a central role in determining whether their regional transportation plans and programs conform to State Implementation Plans for meeting national air quality standards. Travel forecasting models play a principal role in this process as well. The basic modeling approach at most MPOs remains a sequential four- step process by which the number of daily trips is estimated, distributed among origin and destination zones, divided according to mode of travel, and finally assigned to highway and transit networks. The demands on forecasting models have grown significantly in recent years as a result of new policy concerns. Existing models are inadequate to address many of these new concerns.

AB  - The disequilibrium between traffic supply and demand leads to unbalanced traffic flow in urban transportation networks. By analyzing the mutual influence between the traveler route selection and signal timing, a bi-level program model is proposed in order to optimize transportation network efficiency. In light of the similarity between the game theory and the bi-level program, some simple changes are made for the purpose of simplifying the computation of the problem. Finally, a practical network is designed to validate the bi-level program model. Results indicate that the model can improve road network efficiency and decrease vehicle delays. © 2009 ASCE.

AB  - The problem of computing shortest paths in time-dependent networks is considered. This computational problem is at the heart of solution methods to a variety of dynamic network models that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications. The design, implementation, and computational testing are reported for parallel algorithms that exploit possibilities offered by low-cost, commonly available, parallel, and distributed computing platforms to solve many-to-many shortest path problems in time-dependent networks. Five shared-memory implementations and five message-passing implementations are developed. The parallel implementations adopt three decomposition strategies based on the sets of destination nodes, origin nodes, and departure times at origin nodes. The algorithms are coded with two types of parallel computing environments: a message-passing environment based on the parallel virtual machine library and a multithreading environment based on the Sun Microsystems Multi-Threads library. Numerical results are obtained with large-sized dynamic networks and two types of parallel computing platforms: a distributed network of Unix workstations and a Sun shared-memory machine containing eight processors. Satisfactory speedups of sequential algorithms are achieved. Numerical results obtained indicate that, overall, shared-memory platforms appear to be the most appropriate type of parallel computing platforms to solve dynamic shortest path problems that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications.

AB  - A two-layer transportation network design model with three
objectives is introduced. The objectives are: the minimization of the
primary path length (or traveling time) from a predetermined starting
node to a predetermined terminus node; the minimization of the total
distance traversed by the demand to reach a node on the primary path;
and the minimization of the total network construction cost. The problem
is initially formulated as an integer linear programming model. A
combinatoric solution which would be suitable for small networks because
of the large size of the subtour breaking constraints is presented. The
method produces efficient solutions according to the objectives
mentioned above. The criteria of alternate transportation facilities,
environmental concerns, and socio-economic structure are included for
these efficient solutions. By using Zeleny's ideal point approach the
best compromise solution is then selected. The results of a numerical
example are also given. Some potential applications of the model include
the planning of a new highway or rapid transportation system and the
design of an energy distribution system

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The expression of some growth factors in nasal polyps has been examined, although investigations addressing the reason for recurrence in some patients are lacking. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is expressed by inflammatory cells, as well as by endothelial and epithelial cells of nasal polyps. To determine whether VEGF may play a role in the recurrence of nasal polyps, we aimed to compare VEGF expression in recurrent versus non-recurrent polyps. In addition, expression in polyps from asthmatic patients was compared with that in polyps from non-asthmatics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 30 patients with newly diagnosed nasal polyposis were included. Polypectomy was performed at enrolment in the long-term follow-up study. Fifteen patients had only 1 polypectomy (non-recurrence group; median observation period 81 months) and 15 had a median of 6.4 polypectomies (multiple recurrence group; median observation period 108 months). Five of 10 patients with asthma belonged to the non-recurrence group and 5 to the recurrence group. The polyp obtained at the initial polypectomy was examined for expression of VEGF by immunohistochemistry, using a polyclonal antibody. A blinded semi-quantitation and comparison of the intensity of immunolabelling were performed in recurrent versus non-recurrent polyps, as well as in asthmatics versus non-asthmatics. RESULTS: VEGF expression was seen as varying staining of the polyp surface and gland epithelium, as well as of the vessel endothelium and some stromal mono- and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Semi-quantitation of the staining intensity showed no significant differences between recurrent and non-recurrent polyps, or between asthmatics and non-asthmatics. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the level of immunohistochemical expression of VEGF in recurrent and nonrecurrent nasal polyposis is equivalent. Thus, the level of VEGF expression cannot predict a subsequent recurrence. The expression of VEGF is not upregulated in patients with asthma. Further studies are needed to determine the role of VEGF in nasal polyposis, with special reference to different stages of polyp formation, vascularization and growth.

AB  - The goals of this paper are to present criteria, that allow to a priori quantify the attack stability of real world correlated networks of finite size and to check how these criteria correspond to analytic results available for infinite uncorrelated networks. As a case study, we consider public transportation networks (PTN) of several major cities of the world. To analyze their resilience against attacks, either the network nodes or edges are removed in specific sequences (attack scenarios). During each scenario the size S(c) of the largest remaining network component is observed as function of the removed share c of nodes or edges. To quantify the PTN stability with respect to different attack scenarios we use the area below the curve described by S(c) for c ∈ [0, 1] recently introduced (Schneider, C. M. et al. [PNAS 108 (2011) 3838]) as a numerical measure of network robustness. This measure captures the network reaction over the whole attack sequence. We present results of the analysis of PTN stability against node and link-targeted attacks.

AB  - Simian virus 40 (SV40) genome sequences have been detected in human non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) tissues, and past infection with SV40 may be a risk factor for NHL. We conducted a population-based nested case-control study to investigate the association between serum antibodies to SV40 and incident NHL. Two research serum banks were established in Washington County, MD, with >45,000 volunteers contributing blood samples collected in 1974 and 1989. Incident cases of NHL diagnosed through 2002 (n = 170) were identified among participants by linkage to population-based cancer registries. Two controls were matched to each case (n = 340) on age, sex, and date of blood draw. Circulating immunoglobulin G antibodies to SV40 were measured using virus-like particle (VLP) ELISA. Positive samples were tested for cross-reactivity with JC virus (JCV) and BK virus (BKV) through competitive inhibition assays. Associations between SV40 antibody seropositivity and NHL were estimated using conditional logistic regression. Whereas SV40 antibodies were detected by VLP ELISA in 15% of cases and 10% of controls [matched odds ratio (OR), 1.97; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.03-3.76], the SV40 reactivity of 85% of the SV40 antibody-positive sera was decreased by adsorption with BKV and/or JCV VLPs. Antibodies specific for SV40 (not cross-reactive) were identified in only 1.8% of cases and 1.6% of controls (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 0.41-5.52). Our findings suggest that past infection with SV40 is not associated with an increased risk of developing NHL.

AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: We aimed to highlight a rare anatomical variation involving the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and to emphasise its implications for thyroid surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over a period of 13 years, 993 patients underwent thyroid surgery; 1557 recurrent laryngeal nerves (887 on the right side) were exposed. RESULTS: Three non-recurrent laryngeal nerves were found on the right side, associated with a retro-oesophageal subclavian artery. One case was suspected before surgery. DISCUSSION: Several variations in the path and branches of the recurrent laryngeal nerve have been reported in the literature. The frequency of occurrence of a non-recurrent laryngeal nerve is about 1 per cent, for patients undergoing thyroid surgery. Other surgically relevant anatomical variations of the recurrent laryngeal nerve include associations with the inferior thyroid artery and the presence of nerve branches. CONCLUSION: The recurrent laryngeal nerve must be carefully dissected and totally exposed during thyroid surgery in order to best preserve its function. Moreover, the thyroid surgeon must be aware of the existence of anatomical variations, which are not as rare as one may think.

AB  - In connection with the network realization problem the main questions of the algorithm are which edges to choose and what is the budget consequence of that. These problems can be solved by exact optimization methods, but in this case the number of computational steps (additions and comparisons) is an exponential function of the number of nodes. For this reason usually heuristic methods are chosen for solving these problems. Some special problems can be formulated as maximal flow problems. To get the solution we use only maximal flow and shortest route algorithms. Thus we decrease the number of computations, but the size of the network will grow. In this paper, we describe this algorithm to solve the network realization problem. Then we give a transportation network realization problem and show how to solve this problem by the some algorithms.

AB  - AIMS: To determine the incidence, mode of presentation, first line of management and composition of non-recurrent urolithiasis in Kuwait. METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted between January 1999 and December 2002 with non-recurrent urolithiasis were prospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The average annual incidence of hospital admission for non-recurrent urolithiasis in Kuwait was 43.44 per 100,000 population, representing men and women (ratio, 9:1) with a median age of 41.91 years. Of the hospital admissions for non-recurrent urolithiasis, 57.2% of cases were acute. Overall, the most predominant symptom was flank pain, while the least common symptom was acute urinary retention. Ureteroscopic stone manipulation was the most common initial treatment modality in the present series, as it was utilized in 43.3% and 37.09% for patients admitted on elective and emergency basis, respectively. Of the calculi available for chemical analysis, 91% contained calcium, 73% contained calcium oxalate, 17% contained mixed calcium and 1% contained calcium phosphate. The composition of the rest of the stones were urate in 7%, struvite in 1% and cystine in 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Urolithiasis is a common disease in the Kuwait region that mainly presents with flank pain. Ureteroscopic calculus removal is the most common modality of treatment. The majority of the calculi seen in Kuwait contained calcium.

AB  - Recent research on highway congestion has calculated that over 50% of delays are non-recurrent (incident produced). A common inference seems to be that non-recurrent delay constitutes over 50% of the “congestion problem.” But this inference overlooks the fact that non-recurrent delays would not be nearly as large if highways were not already overloaded, and that as travelers respond to changes in non-recurrent delay, additional demand could significantly reduce the percentage gain. Within this paper, the issue of incident delay is examined from the alternative perspective of “effective capacity” (which will be equivalent to the expected capacity over time). When evaluated from this view, strategies aimed at alleviating peak-period, incident-caused congestion (such as Incident Management, IM, and Advanced-Traveler-Information-Systems, ATIS) have only a marginal long-term effect on the average delay of congested highways. The conclusion is that neither ATIS nor IM can be relied on as the solution to peak-period congestion. It is also unrealistic to consider either ATIS or IM as an effective alternative to the conventional strategy of adding lanes and building highways.

AB  - Little research has been done to examine the temporal relationship between serum ferritin and the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The aim of this study was to examine whether serum ferritin levels predict incident fatty liver in non-diabetic men. The study cohort comprised 2410 healthy Korean male who were aged 30 to 59years old with no evidence of ultrasonographically detectable fatty liver (USFL) at baseline. Alcohol intake was assessed with a self-reported questionnaire. At each visit, biochemical and anthropometric measurements and abdominal ultrasonography were done. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate the adjusted hazard ratios in separate models for USFL. During 7545.9 person-years of follow-up, 586 participants developed USFL. The hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for incident USFL comparing the highest quartile of serum ferritin level to the lowest quartile was 1.54 (1.21-1.94) after adjusting for age, body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake, and exercise. That association remained significant after further adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and in time-dependent models. The association between serum ferritin and incident USFL was still significant in the non-overweight group or the no current smoker group. Serum ferritin level was an independent risk factor of incident fatty liver detected by ultrasonography even in non-obese, healthy Korean men. Increased serum ferritin levels appear to be an early predictor for incident fatty liver.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypovitaminosis D has been cross-sectionally associated with dementia and stroke. The objective of this longitudinal study was to determine whether serum vitamin D deficiency at baseline could predict the onset of non-Alzheimer dementias (NAD) within 7 years among older women. METHODS: Forty high-functioning older women (78.4 years, 76.4/82.0; median, 25th/75th percentile) from the EPIDOS Toulouse study were divided into two groups based on vitamin D deficiency (i.e., serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <10 ng/ml) at baseline. At the end of the 7-year follow-up period, women matching the DSM-IV but not the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria were diagnosed with NAD while those matching the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria were considered to have Alzheimer's disease (AD). Subtle cognitive impairments at baseline, cardiovascular risk factors and Parkinson's disease were used as potential confounders. RESULTS: NAD was reported in 6 women (82.8 years, 80.6/86.0) after 7 years of follow-up. More NAD were observed in women with vitamin D deficiency (p = 0.023). There was no between-group difference regarding the onset of AD (p = 0.332). We found an association between vitamin D deficiency at baseline and the onset of NAD (adjusted odds ratio = 19.57, p = 0.042). Conversely, vitamin D deficiency was not associated with AD (p = 0.222). CONCLUSION: Baseline vitamin D deficiency predicted the onset of NAD within 7 years among older women.

AB  - The problem of Network Aggregation is defined as the simplification of the number of nodes and links in a transportation network. The objective of a network aggregation technique is to reproduce the level-of-service attributes (such as travel time) between any two points using a spider network as a proxy for the detailed. The aggregation procedure categorizes links into functional groups such as access, egress, line-haul, bypass and intra zonal circulation—which is a convenient classification in terms of transportation analysis. The technique presented here has several distinguishing advantages. First, certain invariance properties are maintained—for example the total trip miles of travel is the same whether measured in the aggregate or detailed networks. Second, the method is systematic, rather than judgemental, which means the inaccuracies introduced as a result of network aggregation can be measured in a scientific way.

A previous osteotomy predisposed for dislocation, but in no case was this dislocation classified as recurrent. Cases with a previous cervical-femoral fracture were significantly more commonly dislocated compared with coxarthrosis cases. This fact probably could be explained by a high rate of alcoholism in men and old age in women.

AB  -  ABSTRACT The transportation sector consumes 70% of the petroleum that the U.S. uses for fuel, which leads one to study transportation to identify significant opportunities to save energy. Every 1-cent increase in the price of a gallon of gas costs the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) 8 million per year for their 200,000-vehicle fleet. To reduce American dependence on fossil fuels, the carbon footprint left by vehicular fleets should be evaluated. This article reports on the current state of fuel efficiency and fleet efficiency in the U.S., including government, municipal, and large commercial sectors. It also discusses opportunities in behavior modification to improve fleet efficiency. Case studies are presented showing evidence of best practices currently implemented. By studying transportation fleets and educating fleet managers about viable alternatives to improve fleet efficiency, we can save significant amounts of fuel and reduce our carbon footprint. This analysis demonstrates that transportation efficiency is economically feasible for a wide variety of public and private entities and is beneficial to the environment.

AB  - A comprehensive study of static transportation network optimization problems with stochastic user equilibrium constraints is presented. It is explicitly demonstrated that the formulation of the fixed-point problem—in terms of link flows for the general stochastic user equilibrium problem in which the Jacobian matrix of link travel cost functions may not be symmetric—possesses a unique solution with mild conditions. By developing a sensitivity analysis method for the stochastic user equilibrium problem, the study proves that the perturbed equilibrium link flows are continuously differentiable implicit functions with respect to perturbation parameters. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the proposed unified bilevel programming model, which can characterize transportation network optimization problems subject to stochastic user equilibrium constraints, is a smooth optimization problem. In addition, the study presents a single-level continuously differentiable optimization formulation that is equivalent to the unified bilevel programming model. Furthermore, as a unified solution method, a successive quadratic programming algorithm based on the sensitivity analysis method is used to solve the transportation network optimization problems with stochastic user equilibrium constraints. Finally, two examples are used to demonstrate the proposed models and algorithm.

AB  - Tactical planning of operations is comprised of a set of interrelated decisions that aim to ensure an optimal allocation and utilization of resources to achieve the economic and customer service goals of the company. Tactical planning is particularly vital for intercity freight carriers that make intensive use of consolidation operations. Railways and less-than-truckload motor carriers are typical examples of such systems. Service Network Design is increasingly used to designate the main tactical issues for this type of carriers: selection and scheduling of services, specification of terminal operations, routing of freight. The corresponding models usually take the form of network design formulations that are difficult to solve, except in the simplest of cases. The paper presents a state-of-the-art review of service network design modelling efforts and mathematical programming developments for network design. A new classification of service network design problems and formulations is also introduced.

AB  - Purpose of the study: We aimed to highlight a rare anatomical variation involving the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and to emphasise its implications for thyroid surgery. Materials and methods: Over a period of 13 years, 993 patients underwent thyroid surgery; 1557 recurrent laryngeal nerves (887 on the right side) were exposed. Results: Three non-recurrent laryngeal nerves were found on the right side, associated with a retro-oesophageal subclavian artery. One case was suspected before surgery. Discussion: Several variations in the path and branches of the recurrent laryngeal nerve have been reported in the literature. The frequency of occurrence of a non-recurrent laryngeal nerve is about 1 per cent, for patients undergoing thyroid surgery. Other surgically relevant anatomical variations of the recurrent laryngeal nerve include associations with the inferior thyroid artery and the presence of nerve branches. Conclusion: The recurrent laryngeal nerve must be carefully dissected and totally exposed during thyroid surgery in order to best preserve its function. Moreover, the thyroid surgeon must be aware of the existence of anatomical variations, which are not as rare as one may think. (copyright) 2008 JLO (1984) Limited.

AB  - AIM: To analyse nuclear chromatin texture in non-recurrent and recurrent papillary urothelial neoplasms of low malignant potential (PUNLMPs). MATERIALS: Ninety three karyometric features were analysed on haematoxylin and eosin stained sections from 20 PUNLMP cases: 10 from patients with a solitary PUNLMP lesion, who were disease free during at least eight years' follow up, and 10 from patients with unifocal PUNLMP, one or more recurrences being seen during follow up. RESULTS: Kruskal-Wallis analysis was used to search for features showing significant differences between recurrent and non-recurrent cases. Significance was better than p<0.005 for more than 20 features. Based on significance, six texture features were selected for discriminant analysis. Stepwise linear discriminant analysis reduced Wilk's lambda to 0.87, indicating a highly significant difference between the two multivariate data sets, but only modest ability to discriminate (70% correct case classification). A box sequential classifier was used based on data derived from discriminant analysis. The classifier took three classification steps and classified 19 of the 20 cases correctly (95% correct case classification). To determine whether significant case grouping could also be obtained based on an objective criterion, the merged data sets of non-recurrent and recurrent cases were submitted to the unsupervised learning algorithm P-index. Two clusters were formed with significant differences. The subsequent application of a Cooley/Lohnes classifier resulted in an overall correct case classification rate of 85%. CONCLUSIONS: Karyometry and multivariate analyses detect subvisual differences in chromatin organisation state between non-recurrent and recurrent PUNLMPs, thus allowing identification of lesions that do or do not recur.

AB  - Some of the actions taken during Minnesota's implementation of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) are summarized. The focus is on the development of area transportation partnerships (ATPs). The establishment of ATPs was a central tenet in the development of the first state transportation improvement program (STIP). This transportation investment process is but one model for the implementation of ISTEA and the development of a STIP. Minnesota introduced the concept of ATP as a substate, multicounty geographic basis for transportation investment decisions. The partnerships depend on cooperation between all modes and state and local transportation interests. ATPs consist of a combination of local elected officials, local transportation planning representatives, and state transportation officials. These officials work, where possible, through existing organizations, such as the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) districts, metropolitan planning organizations, and regional development organizations. The boundaries selected for the partnerships are based on the Mn/DOT state-aid districts, which respect county lines. The ATPs are responsible for integrating the priorities for highway and transit capital activities using federal aid for highways into a draft areawide transportation improvement program (ATIP). Draft ATIPs include a prioritized list of projects to aid in solving transportation problems and implementing the long-range objectives for the area. Each ATP is responsible for submitting an ATIP to Mn/DOT. Mn/DOT evaluates each ATIP for consistency, determines the appropriate funding level, and consolidates them into the STIP.

AB  - A city and its transportation network are both complicated systems. Fractal geometry provides an effective way to describe the complex property of geographical features. This paper uses a modified box-counting method to describe the fractal property of urban transportation networks. Assuming that human settlements of different sizes are all operated by the same growth procedure, this paper investigates the relationship between the mass size of cities and the complexity of their road systems. The results confirm that, as cities grow from small to large, their transportation networks generally become more complicated -- the urban spaces are filled up more densely by city roads and the locations within a city are more accessible. The quantitative relationship identified between the complexity of urban transportation network and city size provides an empirical guide for the planning and policymaking of urban development and road construction.

The efficiency of 82 road transportation companies responding to a large-scale survey focused on horizontal cooperation is evaluated, based on two inputs and two outputs. Various DEA models are used to identify differences between subgroups of respondents. The results demonstrate that, in general, Flemish road transportation companies operate at unacceptably low efficiency levels. Given the findings that the median company is operating on too small a scale, one apparent remedy would be a dramatic increase in market concentration through mergers and acquisitions.

AB  - Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a benign intra-articular lesion. Patients are at risk for local recurrence. Factors that predict recurrence are not established. Two groups of patients were retrieved from our files. One consisted of 25 patients who had one or more recurrences within 5 years after primary surgery. The second group contained 18 historical controls free of recurrence for at least 5 years after primary surgery. Patient medical records and surgical notes were reviewed. We compared proliferative activity and DNA ploidy using digital image analysis, and other clinicopathologic features between the 2 groups of patients. The location of PVNS was significantly different between the two groups (p=0.03). In the recurrence group, there were 7 (28%) cases with disease in the knee. However, none of the controls had disease in the knee. Among recurrent cases, tumors in the knee were, on average, larger than tumors in the small joints. The size of all recurrent tumors was not significantly different than non-recurrent tumors (median of 1.8 cm versus 1.3 cm, respectively; p=0.06). There were no significant differences in age, sex, completeness of surgical removal, MIB-I index, DNA ploidy, or the percent of tumor nuclei in the diploid, S-phase, tetraploid, or hypertetraploid DNA histogram categories between the two groups. Our results indicate that recurrent PVNS tumors were more likely to be located in the knee, which may be related to larger tumor size. Patient age, sex, completeness of surgical removal, DNA ploidy, and MIB-I proliferation were not significantly different between recurrent and non-recurrent lesions.

AB  - Assessing and prioritising cost-effective strategies to mitigate the impacts of traffic incidents and accidents on non-recurrent congestion on major roads represents a significant challenge for road network managers. This research examines the influence of numerous factors associated with incidents of various types on their duration. It presents a comprehensive traffic incident data mining and analysis by developing an incident duration model based on twelve months of incident data obtained from the Australian freeway network. Parametric accelerated failure time (AFT) survival models of incident duration were developed, including log-logistic, lognormal, and Weibul - considering both fixed and random parameters, as well as a Weibull model with gamma heterogeneity. The Weibull AFT models with random parameters were appropriate for modelling incident duration arising from crashes and hazards. A Weibull model with gamma heterogeneity was most suitable for modelling incident duration of stationary vehicles. Significant variables affecting incident duration include characteristics of the incidents (severity, type, towing requirements, etc.), and location, time of day, and traffic characteristics of the incident. Moreover, the findings reveal no significant effects of infrastructure and weather on incident duration. A significant and unique contribution of this paper is that the durations of each type of incident are uniquely different and respond to different factors. The results of this study are useful for traffic incident management agencies to implement strategies to reduce incident duration, leading to reduced congestion, secondary incidents, and the associated human and economic losses. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a new method using data mining to identify automatically freeway incidents. As a component of a real-time traffic adaptive control system for signal control, the algorithm feeds an incident report to the system's optimization manager, which uses the information to determine the appropriate signal control strategy. Offline tests were conducted to substantiate the performance of the proposed incident detection algorithm based on simulated data. The test results indicate the feasibility of achieving real-time incident detection utilizing the proposed method.

AB  - A non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve (NRILN) is a rare anomaly that may increase the risk of injury during thyroid surgery. A NRILN results from an embryologic developmental abnormality of the aortic arches, demonstrated by the absence of the brachiocephalic artery and the presence of an aberrant subclavian artery (arteria lusoria). In our experience 100% of 104 patients with a NRILN were shown to have these abnormalities. We postulated that duplex scanning of the brachiocephalic artery could identify patients at risk of a NRILN. Twelve patients with an operative diagnosis of a right NRILN and associated vascular abnormalities underwent postoperative duplex scanning of the brachiocephalic artery. The examination was performed using a 7.5 or 3.5 MHz transducer. The average duration of assessment was 5 min. The absence of the brachiocephalic artery and the direct origin of the right common carotid artery from the arch of the aorta were demonstrated in each patient. Duplex scanning is a simple noninvasive method of identifying patients with the arterial abnormalities responsible for a NRILN. This may be used in the preoperative assessment of selected patients.

AB  - Institutionalization after hip fracture occurs in at least 30% of patients in the year following hospital discharge. We demonstrate that the risk of transfer to a long-term care facility, after adjustment for age and burden of co-morbidity, is also increased following fractures at other osteoporotic sites in men and women. For most fractures, men are at greater risk than women. INTRODUCTION: High institutionalization rates have been documented following non-traumatic hip fractures; however, there is lack of knowledge regarding the frequency of transfer to long-term care institutions of patients who sustain such fractures at other anatomical sites. METHODS: Using the comprehensive health care databases of the province of Manitoba, Canada, we performed a retrospective matched cohort study of community-dwelling men and women aged 50 years and older who sustained an incident non-traumatic fracture between April 1, 1986, and March 31, 2006. Using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, we estimated the sex-specific relative risk of transfers to long-term care institutions in the year following fracture at osteoporotic sites. RESULTS: We identified a total of 70,264 individuals with incident fractures (70.0% in women) among whom 3,996 new admissions to long-term care institutions were documented in the year following the index fracture. New admissions increased over time (p < 0.0001 for temporal trends). The age- and co-morbidity-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of institutionalization following a hip fracture was 4.89 (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.19 to 5.69) in men, and this risk was consistently at least twice that of controls for all other fracture sites (all p < 0.0001). In women, the relative risks were highest subsequent to a hip (HR, 2.79; 95% CI, 2.56 to 3.04) or vertebral fracture (HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.82 to 2.62). CONCLUSIONS: Non-traumatic fractures at any site have serious consequences, including institutionalization. Men are at greater risk of transfer to long-term care following fracture than women.

AB  - Since precipitation has a negative impact on traffic congestion, there have been various studies for modeling the relationship between precipitation and its impact on traffic flow. However, due to limitations on existing data, none of the previous studies have accounted for the estimation of the total delay caused by precipitation. The objective of this study is to estimate the non-recurrent traffic congestion on freeways caused by precipitation. To accomplish this objective, archived weather and traffic data for the year 2008 from the Korean Freeway Systems was collected and analyzed. As a result, non-recurrent traffic congestion was about 1.6 million vehicle-hours due to rainfall and 186,000 vehicle-hours due to snowfall in 2008. In addition, simple analyses were performed to describe the average non-recurrent traffic congestion per unit distance as a function of precipitation and a function of the time period of precipitation. Although precipitation events might not be handled by human efforts, these results will assist in making strategic plans such as active speed management and contingency planning for mitigating traffic congestion due to precipitation. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper reports a case of a non-recurrent laryngeal nerve which was accurately predicted pre-operatively using computed tomography.\n\nCASE REPORT: A 61-year-old man presented with papillary thyroid carcinoma with lymph node metastasis. Computed tomography scans of the neck and chest revealed an ill-defined, hypoattenuating nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland, with few upper paratracheal and prevascular nodes, and clear lung fields. The retro-oesophageal course of the right subclavian artery, which was arising from the distal portion of the arch of aorta, was also incidentally revealed in the computed tomography scan. A barium swallow further confirmed the presence of a retro-oesophageal subclavian artery. Total thyroidectomy was performed, with right neck dissection and central compartment clearance. This was carried out with the presence of a non-recurrent laryngeal nerve in mind, and the nerve was accurately localised and preserved.\n\nCONCLUSION: To our knowledge this is the first report in the world literature of accurate pre-operative incidental imaging of the right non-recurrent laryngeal nerve in a case of metastatic thyroid cancer, and the subsequent use of computed tomography to guide surgical navigation.

In this study a bi-level programming model was proposed to optimize the strategy of transportation network capacity improvement in the constraint of budget. The upper level problem aims to minimize the total travel time of all transportation travelers, while the lower level model is users' equilibrium transportation assignment model. A quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm was employed to solve the problem. The result of numerical experiment indicated that the proposed model can reduce total travel time by searching optimal solution and the QEA is more efficient than other heuristic algorithm.

AB  - With recent development in freight transportation industry, its network structure has become more complicated, as many decision-makers competing for profits with each other are involved. While most recent research in this area is focused on the perfectly competitive market and the prices are given as a constant tariff rate, little attention has been paid to the system optimization problem in the absence of regulatory authority. In this paper, we investigate the competitive equilibrium in an oligopolistic market on a freight network. A partially non-cooperative game among shippers, carriers and infrastructure companies (IC) is examined. All three kinds of players act as profit maximizing agents, except that the carriers and ICs are assumed to behave cooperatively in their own coalitions. We consider the vertically efficient nonlinear tariff schedules which are commonly used in the transportation industry. By introducing a three-stage game-theoretic model, we show that the equilibrium flows can also maximize total system profits if the IC and the carrier both use vertically efficient nonlinear pricing schedules. The division of the surplus associated with each shipment is obtained by solving a linear programming problem. We provide a few examples under different situations to show the existence of the resulting equilibrium. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve (NRILN) is a nerve anomaly that can be associated with an increased risk of vocal fold paralysis. The purpose of this study was to report three new cases of this anomaly, underline the necessity of recognizing its possibility for the prevention of intra-operative nerve damage and a review of the literature. Three cases of thyroid surgery associated with right NRILN are reported. Two patients underwent bilateral thyroidectomy for a multinodular goitre and for a toxic multinodular goitre respectively. The third patient had a right lobectomy and isthmectomy for a thyroid nodule. All patients had identification of the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the left side and NRILN on the right side. The diagnosis of the NRILN was made per-operatively on all cases. A post-operative computed tomography (CT) scan in two patients, showed a retrooesophageal aberrant right subclavian artery. Post-operatively, all patients had normal vocal fold function on laryngoscopy. The NRILN is a rare anomaly but overlooking its possibility may lead to severe operative morbidity. This is an additional argument in favour of systematic dissection of the recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve during thyroid surgery.

AB  - Non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve (NRILN) is a rare embryologic anomaly that can increase the risk of injury during thyroid surgery. Although the association between the NRILN and an aberrant right subclavian artery has been reported, to date there have been no reports describing cases of NRILN with multiple vascular abnormalities. A 60-year-old man with papillary thyroid carcinoma and a history of right internal carotid artery occlusion by thrombosis was examined with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). The right NRILN was found during a total thyroidectomy with surrounding lymph node dissection. MRA revealed an aberrant right subclavian artery and aplasia of the bilateral posterior communicating arteries composing the circle of Willis. This is the first clinical report demonstrating NRILN with multiple vascular abnormalities. Patients with NRILN must be examined for vascular anomalies and associated lesions such as aneurysms and thromboembolism.

AB  - A discomforting reality has materialized on the transportation scene: our existing air and ground infrastructures will not scale to meet our nation's 21st century demands and expectations for mobility, commerce, safety, and security. The consequence of inaction is diminished quality of life and economic opportunity in the 21st century. Clearly, new thinking is required for transportation that can scale to meet to the realities of a networked, knowledge-based economy in which the value of time is a new coin of the realm. This paper proposes a framework, or topology, for thinking about the problem of scalability of the system of networks that comprise the aviation system. This framework highlights the role of integrated communication-navigation-surveillance systems in enabling scalability of future air transportation networks. Scalability, in this vein, is a goal of the recently formed Joint Planning and Development Office for the Next Generation Air Transportation System. New foundations for 21st thinking about air transportation are underpinned by several technological developments in the traditional aircraft disciplines as well as in communication, navigation, surveillance and information systems. Complexity science and modern network theory give rise to one of the technological developments of importance. Scale-free (i.e., scalable) networks represent a promising concept space for modeling airspace system architectures, and for assessing network performance in terms of scalability, efficiency, robustness, resilience, and other metrics. The paper offers an air transportation system topology as framework for transportation system innovation. Successful outcomes of innovation in air transportation could lay the foundations for new paradigms for aircraft and their operating capabilities, air transportation system architectures, and airspace architectures and procedural concepts. The topology proposed considers air transportation as a system of networks, within which strategies for scalability of the topology may be enabled by technologies and policies. In particular, the effects of scalable ICNS concepts are evaluated within this proposed topology. Alternative business models are appearing on the scene as the old centralized hub-and-spoke model reaches the limits of its scalability. These models include growth of point-to-point scheduled air transportation service (e.g., the RJ phenomenon and the Southwest Effect). Another is a new business model for on-demand, widely distributed, air mobility in jet taxi services. The new businesses forming around this vision are targeting personal air mobility to virtually any of the thousands of origins and destinations throughout suburban, rural, and remote communities and regions. Such advancement in air mobility has many implications for requirements for airports, airspace, and consumers. These new paradigms could support scalable alternatives for the expansion of future air mobility to more consumers in more places.

Firstly, the signal control of a network is modeled as a discrete-time state space model. It is found that the system is not completely controllable and hence, the system is decomposed into controllable subsystem and free one. To avoid congestion and reduce the impact of disturbance, H∞ control method is adapted and a traffic-responsive strategy under state and control constraints is constructed by means of Linear Matrix Inequality ({LMI).} Finally, a system including two intersections is studied in order to illustrate the result.

The box dimension of different districts of the main city has also been calculated at the scale of 100 to 600 m in this research and the results show that the value is between 1.5027 and 1.6312. It can be concluded that Heping district is the region with the biggest density, most complex structure, best connectivity and most mature function of transportation network in the whole city. According to the study, we obtained that the combination of length-radius dimensions and box dimensions enables the comprehensive analysis of spatial pattern characteristics of density, structure, connectivity and function of transportation network.

AB  - This paper provides techniques, heuristics, and algorithms for the location of a minimal number of relay points on a highway network that satisfies the driver-distance constraint-a driver leaving a distribution center does not travel for more than t miles before which he/she returns back to the originating point or rests before moving on further. Straight Route and Detour versions are considered. Empirical evaluations of the proposed heuristics on road networks are performed. The results indicate that the Straight Route version is computationally efficient but locates a larger number of relay points than the Detour versions. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) may be the most powerful of all environmental laws affecting transportation. They are intended to significantly affect transportation decision-making, not only to achieve air quality goals but also to affect broader environmental goals related to land use, travel mode choice, and reductions in vehicle miles traveled. The CAAA require greater integration of transportation and air quality planning, and assign a greater responsibility to transportation plans and programs for reducing mobile source emissions. By expanding the requirements for determining the conformity of transportation plans, programs, and projects with State Implementation Plans for air quality, and by expanding the use of highway funding sanctions to enforce those requirements, the CAAA ensure a continuing linkage between transportation and environmental goals. While the CAAA give transportation and air quality decision-makers the mandate to better coordinate their respective planning processes, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 offers the tools to help carry out that mandate. Consequently, this paper summa- rizes the transportation and air quality provisions of both of these Acts and their relationships.

AB  - Automatic incident detection and characterization is urgently required in the development of advanced technologies used for reducing non-recurrent traffic congestion on urban traffic. This paper presents a new method which is constructed on the basis of fuzzy value logic to automatically identify freeway incidents. As a component of a real-time traffic adaptive control system for signal control, the algorithm feeds an incident report to the system's optimization manager, which uses the information to determine the appropriate signal control strategy. Off-line tests were conducted to substantiate the performance of the proposed incident detection algorithm based on simulated data. The test results indicate the feasibility of achieving real-time incident detection utilizing the proposed method

AB  - A major problem addressed during the preparation of spatial development plans relates to the accessibility to facilities where services of general interest such as education, health care, public safety, and justice are offered to the population. In this context, planners typically aim at redefining the level of hierarchy to assign to the urban centers of the region under study (with a class of facilities associated with each level of hierarchy) and redesigning the region's transportation network. Traditionally, these two subjects - urban hierarchy and transportation network planning - have been addressed separately in the scientific literature. This paper presents an optimization model that simultaneously determines which urban centers and which network links should be promoted to a new level of hierarchy so as to maximize accessibility to all classes of facilities. The possible usefulness of the model for solving real-world problems of integrated urban hierarchy and transportation network planning is illustrated through an application to the Centro Region of Portugal. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A public transportation network serves in adequate way a population if it evolves in time following the existent social reality. Changes made in order to improve service must be analyzed and evaluated. The introduction of modern technology to validate the fare card allowed a quick access to important, although incomplete, data. Databases with only the getting in validation information can be used to construct an origin–destination (OD) matrix, allowing a service quality analysis. Here it is presented a basic methodology to rigorously validate service quality criteria considering what might be interesting for the user. The quality analysis philosophy is the following. First, based on automatically gathered data, one reconstructs the origin–destination (OD) matrix, which contains information concerning the number of passengers traveling between zones of a certain region. The OD matrix is used to calculate some criteria characterizing the transportation network quality, such as traveling times, waiting times at a stop or transport occupation. The reconstructed OD matrix always contains errors, which cause errors in the criteria values. How significant are these errors? This question can be answered using our criteria validating methodology, which is based on statistical analysis. It has been implemented at the urban bus transport system of Porto, STCP, allowing the evaluation of the transportation network quality under a number of criteria and guaranteeing rigorous results.

AB  - This paper investigates a routing problem in a public transportation network, more precisely the problem of finding an optimal journey plan in a transportation network, given a timetable. The following issues are discussed: a graph model of a transportation network that takes into account changes of means of transport in a non-zero time; reduction of a large network to a network with a smaller number of nodes and arcs, and algorithms that find an optimal connection by different optimality criteria given. It is shown that the routing problem is closely related to the shortest-path problem in a weighted graph. However, well-known graph-theory algorithms cannot be directly applied as the time factor and the effect of changing means of transport require a specific approach. Moreover, miscellaneous constraints may be imposed on the set of acceptable routes. An implementation of the presented approach in a commercial routing program has been described. © 1995.

AB  - Abstract: Despite the growing demands on the U.S. aviation system, the system continues to maintain a high level of safety. There are two ways to prevent fatalities in air travel: by preventing accidents, and by protecting aircraft occupants in the accidents that do occur. A reduction in accident rates provides an indication of the success of accident prevention; examining occupant survivability can indicate the positive results from occupant protection. The importance of examining occupant survivability in aviation accidents is twofold: (1) it can help to dispel a public perception that most air carrier accidents are not survivable, and (2) it can identify things that can be done to increase survivability in the accidents that do occur. The National Transportation Safety Board frequently receives inquiries from the general public and Government agencies concerning the survivability of airplane accidents. Although the Safety Board’s Annual Review of Aircraft Accident Data for U.S. Air Carrier Operations summarizes the degree of occupant injury by aircraft damage, the annual publication has not, in the past, analyzed the issue of survivability in detail. Therefore, the purpose of this safety report is to examine aircraft occupant survivability for air carrier operations in the United States. The Safety Board examined only air carrier operations performed under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 because the majority of the Board’s survival factors investigations are conducted in connection with accidents involving Part 121 carriers. Therefore, more survivability data are available for Part 121 operations than are available for Part 135 and Part 91 (general aviation) operations. This report also examines cause-of-death information for the most serious of the Part 121 accidents; that is, those accidents involving fire, at least one serious injury or fatality, and either substantial aircraft damage or complete destruction.

AB  - Non-recurrent traffic congestion due to incidents, highway construction zones, and special events has contributed up to 60% of the total freeway corridor delay in the United States. Under most scenarios, if proper diversion plans can be implemented in time, motorists can circumvent the congested segments and best use the available corridor capacity. Nevertheless, before the implementation of any detour strategy, traffic managers must ensure the resulting benefits, because implementing those advanced control strategies usually demand substantial amount of resources and manpower. This study, proposed in response to such needs, presents a detour decision methodology for urban freeway non-recurrent congestion management, based on the results of extensive simulation experiments and operational guidelines from highway agencies. The proposed model offers a reliable and effective tool for responsible traffic management personnel to make consistent detour decisions in response to a detected incident. Numerical results clearly indicate that a timely and well-justified detour operation can yield substantial benefits to both the driving population and the entire community. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Proliferative potentials of meningiomas from 127 patients were examined immunohistochemically using the anti-Ki-67 monoclonal antibody, MIB-1, on paraffin sections, and the correlation among MIB-1 staining index (SI), histopathological finding, and clinical course of the disease was analyzed retrospectively. The mean MIB-1 SI of 50 male patients with meningioma was 5.5%, whereas that of 77 female patients was 2.7%. Higher MIB-1 SI were observed for younger patients. These age- and sex-related differences in MIB-1 SI were statistically significant. The patients were assigned to one of three groups: those with non-recurrent meningioma (n = 73); those with recurrent meningioma in whom the specimens obtained during the initial surgery were used to calculate the MIB-1 SI (n = 21); and those with recurrent meningioma for whom the specimens obtained during the surgery for recurrent tumors were used to calculate the MIB-1 SI (n = 33). The mean MIB-1 SI in these patients were 1.6%, 3.6%, and 8.8%, respectively, and there were statistically significant differences among these three groups. Statistical analyses reveal that meningiomas with a MIB-1 SI of 3% or more have a significantly high tendency for recurrence during the clinical courses, especially within the first 10-year follow-up periods. Moreover, there is statistically significant correlation between MIB-1 SI and recurrence in each Simpson's grade. The time interval to the next recurrence for recurrent meningiomas is associated with the proliferative potential represented by the MIB-1 SI, and a correlation equation has been proposed to predict the date of the next recurrence. Analyses on cellularity of meningiomas revealed no statistically significant difference in cellularity between non-recurrent and recurrent meningiomas. There was no statistically significant relationship between cellularity and MIB-1 SI of meningiomas. In conclusion, examination on proliferative potentials of meningiomas using MIB-1 SI is very important for biological and histopathological analyses and the prediction of future recurrence.

AB  - It is now widely established that systematic intraoperative location and diligent dissection of the recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve during thyroidectomy are the keystones to assure its anatomic and functional preservation. The possibility of abnormal routes, like a non-recurrent cervical course of the inferior laryngeal nerve is an additional major argument for its systematic identification to avoid surgical damage. In 2517 cervicotomies performed between 1992 and 1997 for at least right thyroid lobe excision or parathyroid glands exploration, 20 cases of non recurrent laryngeal nerve were identified (0.79%). The embryological nature of such a nervous anatomical variation results originally from a vascular disorder, named arteria lusoria in which the fourth right aortic arch is abnormally absorbed, being therefore unable to drag the right recurrent laryngeal nerve down when the heart descends and the neck elongates during embryonic development. The surgeon must be aware of the possibility of a non recurrent laryngeal nerve, which arises directly from the cervical vagus and therefore represents a severe potential pitfall during thyroidectomy. Given the absence of reliable clinical symptoms and signs or investigations indicating preoperatively the possibility of a non recurrent nerve, guidelines are given to prevent intraoperatively this major surgical risk.

AB  - Objective: A non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve is a rare anomaly in which the nerve enters the larynx directly off the cervical vagus nerve, without descending to the thoracic level. It is very susceptible to damage during surgery. This report describes the important pre-operative radiological evaluations and surgical landmarks in a case of a non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve, identified during the recently developed technique of robotic thyroidectomy. Case report: A 38-year-old woman presented with suspected papillary microcarcinoma, as indicated by aspiration cytology. Pre-operative computed tomography showed a right aberrant subclavian artery that indicated a possible right non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve. Using robotic thyroidectomy methods, it was possible to carefully dissect along the thyroid capsule. The laryngeal entrance point of the right non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve (a constant anatomical landmark) was successfully identified via the three-dimensional, high-magnification views provided by the robotic endoscope. Conclusion: With proper knowledge of radiological and surgical anatomy, and the benefits of high-magnification endoscopic views, a non-recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve can be safely preserved during robotic surgery.

AB  - Several recurrent common chromosomal deletion and duplication breakpoints have been localized to large, highly homologous, low-copy repeats (LCRs). The mechanism responsible for these rearrangements, viz., non-allelic homologous recombination between LCR copies, has been well established. However, fewer studies have examined the mechanisms responsible for non-recurrent rearrangements with non-homologous breakpoint regions. Here, we have analyzed four uncommon deletions of 17p11.2, involving the Smith-Magenis syndrome region. Using somatic cell hybrid lines created from patient lymphoblasts, we have utilized a strategy based on the polymerase chain reaction to refine the deletion breakpoints and to obtain sequence data at the deletion junction. Our analyses have revealed that two of the four deletions are a product of Alu/Alu recombination, whereas the remaining two deletions result from a non-homologous end-joining mechanism. Of the breakpoints studied, three of eight are located in LCRs, and five of eight are within repetitive elements, including Alu and MER5B sequences. These findings suggest that higher-order genomic architecture, such as LCRs, and smaller repetitive sequences, such as Alu elements, can mediate chromosomal deletions via homologous and non-homologous mechanisms. These data further implicate homologous recombination as the predominant mechanism of deletion formation in this genomic interval.

AB  - Infrastructure resiliency, particularly related to transportation networks, is essential to any society, especially when considering natural (and man-made) disasters. Recent events around the globe, including Hurricane Katrina, as well as significant seismic events in Haiti, Chile and Japan, have increased the awareness and importance of this fact. Transportation systems are key to response and recovery. They must be able to withstand stress, maintaining baseline service levels, and be stout in physical design and operational concept in order to provide restoration to the system, thus preventing a destructive event from becoming the catalyst for a degenerative epoch. Analyzing the resiliency of a transportation network will aid decision-makers in identifying specific weaknesses within the network, thus allowing the proper prioritization of investments and improvement projects. This paper expands on previous research in quantifying network resiliency. Through the proposed methodology, properly understanding and applying network resiliency may preclude many of the devastating effects caused by destabilizing events, thus preserving quality of life and economic stability.

By concurrently optimizing both the vehicle and network de¯nition for a selected few cities with a ¯xed demand, we obtain a minimum of a ten percent improvement in cost over that obtained by optimizing the network design using a set of pre-de¯ned aircrafts. Additionally, by comparing the concur- rently optimized solutions with the solutions obtained by traditional vehicle optimization, a minimum of an eleven percent improvement in cost is realized.

AB  - When evaluating the earthquake risk to transportation system it is important to take into account the integrated effect of ground motion, liquefaction, and landslides on the network components and system. In this article, the risk from earthquakes to a transportation system is evaluated in terms of direct loss from damage to bridges and travel delays in the transportation network. The contribution of site effects to the loss from damage to bridges is estimated using the San Francisco Bay area as a test bed. Damage and loss to bridges from ground shaking and ground displacements (vertical and horizontal) from liquefaction and landslides are computed for a magnitude 7.0 scenario earthquake on the Hayward fault in California. It is found that liquefaction damage is the largest contributor to the repair cost which is used as a measure of the loss from damage. The performance of the transportation network is evaluated in terms of travel delay times. Travel delays resulting from damage due to ground shaking and changes in travel times are evaluated for the scenario event under the assumptions of fixed and variable travel demands. It is found that with fixed travel demand, the post-event travel times increase significantly. Travel times remain relatively unchanged and decrease with the variable demand time assumption.

Tactical planning is particularly vital for intercity freight carriers that make intensive use of consolidation operations. Railways and less-than-truckload motor carriers are typical examples of such systems. Service Network Design is increasingly used to designate the main tactical issues for this type of carriers: selection and scheduling of services, specification of terminal operations, routing of freight. The corresponding models usually take the form of network design formulations that are difficult to solve, except in the simplest of cases. The paper presents a state-of-the-art review of service network design modelling e orts and mathematical programming developments for network design.

AB  - Travellers attempting to make a non-recurrent trip cannot rely on their own experiences and, consequently, must rely on information generated by others. In such situations, travellers' choices are subject to information transmissions through a social network; if this does not work well, they fail to make efficient choices owing to lack of information. This study proposes a model that describes the dynamics of information generation and transmissions and conducts an analysis to investigate the conditions that allow travellers to make efficient choices. It is shown that suppressing rapid diffusions of information and encouraging intentional searching for information can help travellers to make efficient choices. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper proposes a new specialized centrality measure to quantify the importance and the contribution amount of each street in an urban transportation network. Contrary to the previous general centrality measures (e.g., degree, betweenness, and closeness), this measure considers three important vehicular traffic characteristics: street capacity restrictions, the dominant pattern of travel demands, and the traffic-flow equilibrium. Applying the developed centrality measure to simulated networks shows that traffic flows more efficiently in urban networks with " small-world" configurations, where a certain number of shortcut links and locally clustered streets are allowed. However, with regular grid networks, the application of the proposed measure shows little efficiency. This outcome suggests that the regular grid is not suitable as a base structure in urban planning. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Complex networks provide a suitable framework to characterize air traffic. Previous works described the world air-transport network as a graph where direct flights are edges and commercial airports are vertices. In this work, we focus instead on the properties of flight delays in the US air- transportation network. We analyze flight performance data in 2010 and study the topological structure of the network as well as the aircraft rotation. The properties of flight delays, including the distribution of total delays, the dependence on the day of the week and the hour-by-hour evolution within each day, are characterized with special attention to flights accumulating delays longer than 12 hours. We find that the distributions are robust to changes in takeoff or landing operations, different moments of the year, or even different airports in the contiguous states. However, airports in remote areas (Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico) can show peculiar distributions biased toward long delays. Additionally, we show that long-delayed flights have an important dependence on the destination airport. Keywords

We incorporate the path accumulating characteristic and network coding technique to improve PEER protocol with the aim of achieving energy efficiency as much as possible. The results of simulation in both static scenarios and mobile scenarios show that ORE achieves better performance than the existing protocols.

This paper presents a hi-level optimization model-in\nwhich the spatial equity issue is explicitly considered for the first\ntime-for solving the public transportation network redesign problem\n(PTNRP). The goal of the upper-level subprogram is to minimize total\ncost, including user cost, operator cost, and unsatisfied demand cost,\nfor the studied bus transit network, subject to a variety of resource-\nand policy-related constraints. The lower-level subprogram is a user\nself-routing optimization problem in which all transit users try to find\nthe transit route to minimize their own travel cost (or time) and number\nof transfers in the network. Then, a procedure for a genetic\nalgorithm-based solution is developed to solve this PTNRP hi-level\noptimization model. Network experiments are conducted, and numerical\nresults are described.

AB  - In combination, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) and the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) are innovative and aggressive efforts to move US cities toward integrated transportation and air quality planning. Under these complementary laws, air quality has become a major national transportation goal. In areas with serious air pollution, air quality will be a major consideration in determining the future shape of urban transportation. This paper considers how the CAAA and ISTEA combine to provide an innovative national policy approach of interest to countries seeking to encourage sustainable development in urban centers. The CAAA mandates measurable and enforceable air quality targets. Nation-wide standards are set for acceptable levels of carbon monoxide, ground level ozone, and small particulates. ISTEA includes directions for transportation planners and decision-makers to follow to reach air quality and other goals - transportation planning must emphasize system effi- ciency, and for cities with severe air pollution, transportation projects are expected to contribute to cleaner air. Each urban area has flexibility in how it applies this framework to reflect its priorities and solve its problems. Strict federal sanctions provide incentives for compliance with both laws. Enactment of these laws has produced a period of transition and uncertainty as well as of challenge and opportunity for planners and elected officials. The next several years, the US will provide one national laboratory and over 100 different urban laboratories for innovative approaches to integrate transportation and environmental policies to resolve major urban problems.

AB  - A simulation-based framework for the modeling of transportation network performance under emergency conditions is presented. The system extends the well-established dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) framework and provides the necessary support for the meaningful study of a wide array of evacuation measures, the development of strategies under different prevailing conditions, and the generation of comprehensive emergency response plans. The system can be used to develop libraries to deal with emergencies and unplanned events, train response personnel and traffic management center operators, provide decision support and assistance for the evacuation of residents from affected areas, and ensure unhindered access to first responders. A variety of practical issues relevant to evacuation modeling are discussed, and the modeling framework is demonstrated by using the Boston, Massachusetts, network as an example. DynaMIT, a state-of-the-art DTA model, is used in the case study to illustrate how the benefits of network management strategies might be ascertained. The paper concludes with future directions, including the integration of simulation modeling as a real-time tool for the management of evolving evacuations.

AB  - Tactical planning of operations is comprised of a set of interrelated decisions that aim to ensure an optimal allocation and utilization of resources to achieve the economic and customer sen ice goals of the company. Tactical planning is particularly vital for intercity freight carriers that make intensive use of consolidation operations. Railways and less-than-truckload motor carriers are typical examples of such systems. Service Network Design is increasingly used to designate the main tactical issues for this type of carriers: selection and scheduling of services, specification of terminal operations, routing of freight. The corresponding models usually take the form of network design formulations that are difficult to solve, except in the simplest of cases. The paper presents a state-of-the-art review of service network design modelling efforts and mathematical programming developments for network design.

From a given timetable, we aim to find a new schedule of various buses after detection of a disturbance at a given time. The main objective is to find a solution maximizing the level of service for all passengers by minimising their waiting times at stops and theirs transit times in connecting nodes. This problem was already studied with evolutionary approaches and multi-agents techniques without analyzing or identifying its type before. In this paper, we prove that the problem has an optimal solution in the case of illimited buses capacities and we propose a formulation which allows its resolution without requiring the use of metaheuristics. Numerical experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the theoretical formulation comparing it with evolutionary approaches.

The purpose of this study was to report three new cases of this anomaly, underline the necessity of recognizing its possibility for the prevention of intra-operative nerve damage and a review of the literature. Three cases of thyroid surgery associated with right NRILN are reported. Two patients underwent bilateral thyroidectomy for a multinodular goitre and for a toxic multinodular goitre respectively. The third patient had a right lobectomy and isthmectomy for a thyroid nodule. All patients had identification of the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the left side and NRILN on the right side. The diagnosis of the NRILN was made per-operatively on all cases. A post-operative computed tomography (CT) scan in two patients, showed a retrooesophageal aberrant right subclavian artery. Post-operatively, all patients had normal vocal fold function on laryngoscopy. The NRILN is a rare anomaly but overlooking its possibility may lead to severe operative morbidity. This is an additional argument in favour of systematic dissection of the recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve during thyroid surgery.

AB  - Little research has been done to examine the temporal relationship between serum ferritin and the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The aim of this study was to examine whether serum ferritin levels predict incident fatty liver in non-diabetic men. The study cohort comprised 2410 healthy Korean male who were aged 30 to 59years old with no evidence of ultrasonographically detectable fatty liver (USFL) at baseline. Alcohol intake was assessed with a self-reported questionnaire. At each visit, biochemical and anthropometric measurements and abdominal ultrasonography were done. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate the adjusted hazard ratios in separate models for USFL. During 7545.9 person-years of follow-up, 586 participants developed USFL. The hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for incident USFL comparing the highest quartile of serum ferritin level to the lowest quartile was 1.54 (1.21-1.94) after adjusting for age, body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake, and exercise. That association remained significant after further adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and in time-dependent models. The association between serum ferritin and incident USFL was still significant in the non-overweight group or the no current smoker group. Serum ferritin level was an independent risk factor of incident fatty liver detected by ultrasonography even in non-obese, healthy Korean men. Increased serum ferritin levels appear to be an early predictor for incident fatty liver.

AB  - This study integrates three data mining techniques, K-means clustering, decision trees, and neural networks, to predict the travel time of freeway with non-recurrent congestion. By creating dummy variables and identifying important variables, not only is the prediction performance increased without increasing investment in equipment, but also important variables are obtained concerning the important locations of equipment in order to effectively assist public transit agencies with system maintenance. The experimental results for a segment of 36.1km of National Freeway No. 1, Taiwan, with non-recurrent congestion show that, whether or not the data generated by the Electronic Toll Collection (etc) system is used as input variables, the travel time prediction method developed in this study is able to improve the prediction performance. Meanwhile, the proposed approach also reduces the percentage of samples with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)>20%. Furthermore, in this study, important variables are extracted from the decision tree in order to predict the travel time. Finally, the prediction models constructed in accordance with six scenarios are highly accurate due to the low MAPE values, which are from 6% to 9%.

The concept of ??-robust solution is introduced into the transportation network design problem. We propose a robust transportation network design model with regret value constraints, then design an algorithm based on the genetic algorithm to solve the problem and obtain the optimal solutions for different regret values. Finally, numerical results based on the Nguyen-Dupuis network validate the effectiveness of the algorithm. While detailed analysis on trade-offs, between the expected travel time and the maximum regret value, shows that large reductions in maximum regret do not necessarily result in a great increase in expected travel time. Meanwhile, we compared the robust model presented with the stochastic model and numerical examples demonstrate that the robust planning network is more reliable and less risky than the stochastic model if demand uncertainty is considered in modeling. ?? 2013 Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology.

However, such research is inadequate in such areas as traffic flow prediction, traffic simulation and incident management. This article presents microscopic lane traffic models to characterise incident-induced driver behaviour including car following and lane changing conducted under conditions of lane-blocking arterial incidents. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed models, a specific microscopic traffic simulation program embedded with the proposed incident-induced lane traffic behaviour models is tested by comparing simulation data with video-based incident data collected from five incident events. Preliminary test results indicate that the proposed microscopic traffic behaviour models permit not only reproducing incident-induced traffic behaviour but also characterising incident effects on lane traffic phenomena. © 2013 Copyright Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Limited.

AB  - Compact city development has, over the last 20 years or so, emerged as the preferred response to the goal of sustainable development. As such, it is pertinent to examine planning practices to see whether the traditional economic bias in planning is now balanced by aims and practices in support of environmental and social sustainability. In this light the social, environmental, and economic goals linked to densification and mixed use development will be the main focus of this article. In addition, the article assesses whether distinct institutional practices support the balancing of these goals. The empirical basis is formed by urban plans in four Scandinavian cities in combination with qualitative interview data. The article concludes that on a discursive level, social, environmental and economic goals are represented in compact city strategies. Institutionalised practices, however, show that economic goals remain at the core of planning. Environmental and social aims still play second fiddle, but new measures are in development that may gradually strengthen their influence over urban development practices.

AB  - Congestion is increasingly becoming a problem for developed countries like the Netherlands. Especially non-recurrent congestion is expected to present the largest difficulties to travelers, because of its unpredictable nature. ITS is one of the available methods for dealing with congestion. For this research project, traffic and travel information is the viewpoint for looking at congestion. This paper selects three non-recurrent traffic situations based on a traffic and road user side of non-recurrence. The traffic side deals with actual figures of congestion and reliability. The road user side presents the road users. The three situations (accidents, road works and large events) are used for further research regarding information needs and route choice.

AB  - Traffic incidents constitute a major cause for non-recurrent roadway congestion. This paper proposes a stochastic-programming model for clearing asymmetrical incidents in a network as quickly as possible. A response to an incident is asymmetric when the workloads among response vehicles are uneven due to real-time scheduling considerations. This is to be contrasted with a static (often conservative) allocation of vehicular resources. Such asymmetry, and the attendant efficiency, is attributable to additional services performed while a vehicle takes care of emergent incidents nearby. Other vehicles are simply too far away to be helpful. We articulate a fundamental principle of incident management in a theorem and three corollaries. An elegant (yet practical) corollary suggests that an operator should not dispatch additional response vehicles (say from a depot) when the shortest travel-times to an incident are longer than the remaining work time available from vehicles already at the scene. Otherwise, the maximum number of required vehicles should be dispatched. When executed over all instances of reported incidents on a rolling time horizon, the rule yields the optimal plan. The model is applied toward a network in Central Arkansas for peak and off-peak traffic. It shows that it can properly balance the service requirement of reported incidents with potential ones. Meanwhile, a certain reliability level can be guaranteed by our model-a threshold that can be tightened or relaxed at will. The fast solution time of this linearized model allows for real-time application in the field, as verified by a simulation performed on a Central Arkansas highway network. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we investigate a model that simultaneously optimizes facility locations and the design of the underlying transportation network. Motivated by the simple observation that changing the network topology is often more cost-effective than adding facilities to improve service levels, the model has a number of applications in regional planning, distribution, energy management, and other areas. The model generalizes the classical simple plant location problem. We show how the model can be solved effectively. We then use the model to analyze two potential transportation planning scenarios. The fundamental question of resource allocation between facilities and links is investigated, and a detailed sensitivity analysis provides insight into the model's usefulness for aiding budgeting and planning decisions.

AB  - This work studies a lane reservation problem in a transportation network. It aims to design task paths and optimally select lanes to be reserved in a transportation network. In this problem, each lane has limited residual capacity, which is the lane capacity that can be used for the tasks causing no delay in this lane. If the residual capacity of a lane is not large enough to allow tasks to use it, the reservation of this lane is necessary. Once reserved, the lane can be used by the tasks only. Therefore, the travel time in this reserved lane is less than that when it is not reserved. Such lane reservation strategy ensures that each task can transport the commodity from its source to destination within a given travel time. However, this reserved lane generates traffic impact on nonreserved lanes. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total impact of all reserved lanes on nonreserved lanes subject to the timely completion of all the concerned tasks. In this paper, two integer linear programming models are, for the first time, formulated. The complexity of the problem is demon- strated to be non-deterministic polynomial-time hard. Then, an optimal algorithm based on the cut-and-solvemethod is developed for the problem. The computational results of randomly generated network instances up to 120 nodes and 468 arcs show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the direct use of an optimization solver of CPLEX.

AB  - The effect of the application of advanced transport information system (ATIS) and road pricing is studied in a transportation system under non-recurrent congestion. A stochastic network deterministic user equilibrium model (SNDUE) with elastic demand is formulated and used to evaluate the welfare and private impacts of different market penetrations of ATIS, together with road pricing for a simple network. Both marginal first-best road pricing and a second-best fixed road pricing are considered. The incentives of private users to use ATIS are analyzed and the characteristics of optimum tolls as a function of ATIS market penetration are shown. We conclude that ATIS is an efficient and necessary tool to reduce the effects of non-recurrent incidents in a transportation network, especially when non-recurrent congestion causes a significant deterioration of operational conditions of the network. If the impact of non-recurrent incidents on free flow costs is small or is reduced only to congestion effects, the use of road pricing would be more efficient. Social benefits obtained when jointly implementing ATIS and road pricing are practically the same whether first-best or second-best road pricing is used. Considering the private costs perceived by the network users, and the benefits experienced by equipped users, the maximum level of market penetration achieved could be limited because private benefits disappear after certain market penetration is obtained. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The issue of planning for adequate capacity in transportation systems to accommodate growing traffic demand is becoming a serious problem. Recent research has introduced "capacity reliability" as a new network performance index. Capacity reliability is defined as the probability that a network can accommodate a certain volume of traffic demand at a required service level given variable arc capacities, while accounting for drivers' route choice behavior. Previous papers on this topic provide a comprehensive methodology for assessing capacity reliability along with extensive simulation results. However, an important issue that remains is what type of route choice model should be used to model driver behavior in estimating network capacity reliability. Three different route choice models (one deterministic and two stochastic models) are compared, and the effect of using each of these models on estimating network capacity reliability is examined.

AB  - Genomic disorders are often caused by recurrent copy number variations\n(CNVs), with nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) as the underlying\nmechanism. Recently, several microhomology-mediated repair mechanisms--such\nas microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ), fork stalling and template\nswitching (FoSTeS), microhomology-mediated break-induced replication\n(MMBIR), serial replication slippage (SRS), and break-induced SRS\n(BISRS)--were described in the etiology of non-recurrent CNVs in\nhuman disease. In addition, their formation may be stimulated by\ngenomic architectural features. It is, however, largely unexplored\nto what extent these mechanisms contribute to rare, locus-specific\npathogenic CNVs. Here, fine-mapping of 42 microdeletions of the FOXL2\nlocus, encompassing FOXL2 (32) or its regulatory domain (10), serves\nas a model for rare, locus-specific CNVs implicated in genetic disease.\nThese deletions lead to blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES), a developmental\ncondition affecting the eyelids and the ovary. For breakpoint mapping\nwe used targeted array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH),\nquantitative PCR (qPCR), long-range PCR, and Sanger sequencing of\nthe junction products. Microhomology, ranging from 1 bp to 66 bp,\nwas found in 91.7% of 24 characterized breakpoint junctions, being\nsignificantly enriched in comparison with a random control sample.\nOur results show that microhomology-mediated repair mechanisms underlie\nat least 50% of these microdeletions. Moreover, genomic architectural\nfeatures, like sequence motifs, non-B DNA conformations, and repetitive\nelements, were found in all breakpoint regions. In conclusion, the\nmajority of these microdeletions result from microhomology-mediated\nmechanisms like MMEJ, FoSTeS, MMBIR, SRS, or BISRS. Moreover, we\nhypothesize that the genomic architecture might drive their formation\nby increasing the susceptibility for DNA breakage or promote replication\nfork stalling. Finally, our locus-centered study, elucidating the\netiology of a large set of rare microdeletions involved in a monogenic\ndisorder, can serve as a model for other clustered, non-recurrent\nmicrodeletions in genetic disease.

AB  - Spatial equity is an extremely important issue in both design of a new and redesign of an existing transit (and highway) network because it is concerned with the benefit distribution among transit (and highway) network users. This paper presents a bi-level optimization model—in which the spatial equity issue is explicitly considered for the first time— for solving the public transportation network redesign problem (PTNRP). The goal of the upper-level subprogram is to minimize total cost, includ- ing user cost, operator cost, and unsatisfied demand cost, for the studied bus transit network, subject to a variety of resource- and policy-related constraints. The lower-level subprogram is a user self-routing optimiza- tion problem in which all transit users try to find the transit route to minimize their own travel cost (or time) and number of transfers in the network. Then, a procedure for a genetic algorithm–based solution is developed to solve this PTNRP bi-level optimization model. Network experiments are conducted, and numerical results are described. Future research directions are also given.

AB  - Connectionist learning procedures are applied to the task of
speaker-independent continuous speech recognition, creating a system
which has achieved a recognition rate of 97% correct in preliminary
tests on the Texas Instruments/National Bureau of Standards Connected
Digits Database. Two versions of the system were implemented, both of
which used four-layer backpropagation networks. One used a static
(nonrecurrent) network with a history mechanism, in which the input
weights were slaved together, as they are in time-delay neural networks
(TDNNs), and the other used a recurrent connection structure similar to
that proposed by J.L. Elman (Tech. Rep., Univ. of California, San Diego,
April 1988). The final recognition accuracies produced by the two
approaches were not significantly different. The networks generated and
refined hypotheses about the identity of utterances over successive
intervals. The hypotheses generated by the networks were used as input
to a Markov-chain-based Viterbi recognizer which produced a final
identification of the entire utterance

AB  - Purpose of the study: We aimed to highlight a rare anatomical variation involving the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and to emphasise its implications for thyroid surgery. Materials and methods: Over a period of 13 years, 993 patients underwent thyroid surgery; 1557 recurrent laryngeal nerves (887 on the right side) were exposed. Results: Three non-recurrent laryngeal nerves were found on the right side, associated with a retro-oesophageal subclavian artery. One case was suspected before surgery. Discussion: Several variations in the path and branches of the recurrent laryngeal nerve have been reported in the literature. The frequency of occurrence of a non-recurrent laryngeal nerve is about I per cent, for patients undergoing thyroid surgery. Other surgically relevant anatomical variations of the recurrent laryngeal nerve include associations with the inferior thyroid artery and the presence of nerve branches. Conclusion: The recurrent laryngeal nerve must be carefully dissected and totally exposed during thyroid surgery in order to best preserve its function. Moreover, the thyroid surgeon must be aware of the existence of anatomical variations, which are not as rare as one may think.

AB  - The role of stress in the onset and frequency of recurrent dreams was investigated by comparing dream recall of students undergoing naturalistic stress conditions. Thirty nine students in active, past and non-recurrent dream groups (n = 13) recorded frequency of nights per week involving overall and recurrent dream recall in the week prior to mid-term examinations and in a neutral study week in second semester self-report measures of everyday hassles and uplifts, anxiety and positive and negative affect experienced during these conditions were also collected. Anxiety and negative effect were reported as significantly higher in the pre-examination week. Overall the groups reported dreams on significantly more nights in the pre-examination week than the post examination week. Recurrent dream nights increased during the stress week for the active recurrent dream group but there was no change in recurrent dream recall for the other groups. These findings are consistent with theories that the experience of emotional stress is a critical factor in the onset and persistence of recurrent dreams.

AB  - Current trends in public transportation have led to an increased interest in smart ticketing systems. Driven by a myriad of forcesincluding governmental privacy requirements and the desire organizations are seeking ways to offer better services, reduce operating expenses, increase ticketing efficiency, safety, reduce fraud, and maximize the opportunities for fare price discrimination. The resulting desire is for a ticketing system that allows for uninterrupted travel between Public Transportation Operators (PTOs), whether this be between cities or entire countries. Simply put, one ticketing system should allow for a seamless travel experience between geographies, allowing the traveler to have an uninterrupted door-to-door travel experience. But because traditional Electronic Fare Management systems have catered to the needs of each independent PTO, increasingly difficult to achieve mutual acceptance among it has become different PTOs. Accordingly, there are three options to accomplish this interoperability from the travelers perspective: on the card level, the application level, or the product level.

AB  - We present an approach to systematically analyzing the vulnerability\nof road networks under\n\ndisruptions covering extended areas. Since various kinds of events\nincluding floods, heavy\n\nsnowfall, storms and wildfires can cause such spatially spread degradations,\nthe analysis method is\n\nan important complement to the existing studies of single link failures.\nThe methodology involves\n\ncovering the study area with grids of uniformly shaped and sized cells,\nwhere each cell represents\n\nthe extent of an event disrupting any intersecting links. We apply\nthe approach to the Swedish\n\nroad network using travel demand and network data from the Swedish\ntransport modeling system\n\nSampers. Among other things, the study shows that the impacts of area-covering\ndisruptions are\n\nlargely determined by the level of internal, outbound and inbound\ntravel demand of the affected\n\narea itself. This is unlike single link failures, where the link flow\nand the redundancy in the\n\nsurrounding network determine the impacts. As a result, the vulnerability\nto spatially spread\n\nevents shows a markedly different geographical distribution. These\nfindings, which should be\n\nuniversal for most road networks of similar scale, are important in\nthe planning process of\n\nresource allocation for mitigation and recovery.

AB  - Europe faces major challenges when it comes to formulating its transportation policy. Information and communication technologies (ICT) are considered a key tool to create the intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that Europe needs. In freight transportation, ICT is seen as playing a crucial role in providing efficiency in freight transportation operation and in integrating it within the overall ITS that are now being put in place in Europe. The issues and priorities for freight transportation integration with the European ITS are presented, with concentration (as one such priority) on the issue of linking freight transportation management systems with the advanced traffic-management systems of the European ITS. Also covered are the results so far of the thematic network THEMIS, which concentrates on the relation between freight transportation and ITS. A thematic network is a special type of research project, financed by the European Union's Directorate General of Transport and Energy in order to review and synthesize the results of research in a specific field, in this case freight transportation. The efforts made at the European level toward the formulation of a common, ITS-based freight transportation systems architecture are also reviewed. In this respect, there is a report on work done within project THEMIS.

AB  - The Bío Bío Region has pioneered regional development in Chile. It has a high concentration of higher education and research activity. Its universities and other higher education institutions have made significant progress in widening access to education. But challenges remain: the Bío Bío Region continues to suffer from brain drain as well as higher than average unemployment and poverty rates. How can the Bío Bío Region promote new business formation and the development of the existing small and medium-sized companies? What incentives are needed to improve higher education institutions’ regional and local orientation? How can higher education institutions move from knowledge generation towards knowledge transfer? This joint OECD and World Bank review explores a range of helpful policy measures and institutional reforms to mobilise higher education for the development of the Bío Bío Region. It is part of the series of the OECD reviews of Higher Education in Regional and City Development. These reviews help mobilise higher education institutions for economic, social and cultural development of cities and regions. They analyse how the higher education system impacts upon regional and local development and bring together universities, other higher education institutions and public and private agencies to identify strategic goals and to work towards them.

The model seeks to maximize expected system capacity subject to uncertainty that will occur in the future demand pattern and with a limited budget for investment. Simulated annealing is used to solve the investment planning problem. A case study of a simplified version of the western U.S. double-stack container network is included to illustrate the application of the model.

AB  - PURPOSE: Damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) during thyroid or parathyroid surgery is the most common iatrogenic cause of vocal cord paralysis. Identification of the RLNs and meticulous surgical technique can significantly decrease the incidence of this complication. Nonrecurrent RLNs (NRRLNs) are exceedingly rare. Surgeons need to be aware of their position to avoid injuries. PATIENT AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 263 right RLN exposures (and 251 left RNL) over a 5-year period was performed. RESULTS: Two NRRLNs were encountered, for an incidence of 0.39% (0.76% only for right dissection), without anatomic anomalies on the left side. The nerve anomaly was never preoperatively diagnosed. CONCLUSION: NRRLNs are rare and is associated with a right subclavian artery arising from distal aortic arch. Awareness of their existence and correct surgical technique will prevent the surgeon from accidentally lesion of NRRLN one if it is encountered during thyroid or parathyroid surgery.

AB  - Little research has been done to examine the temporal relationship between serum ferritin and the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The aim of this study was to examine whether serum ferritin levels predict incident fatty liver in non-diabetic men. The study cohort comprised 2410 healthy Korean male who were aged 30 to 59years old with no evidence of ultrasonographically detectable fatty liver (USFL) at baseline. Alcohol intake was assessed with a self-reported questionnaire. At each visit, biochemical and anthropometric measurements and abdominal ultrasonography were done. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate the adjusted hazard ratios in separate models for USFL. During 7545.9 person-years of follow-up, 586 participants developed USFL. The hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for incident USFL comparing the highest quartile of serum ferritin level to the lowest quartile was 1.54 (1.21-1.94) after adjusting for age, body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake, and exercise. That association remained significant after further adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and in time-dependent models. The association between serum ferritin and incident USFL was still significant in the non-overweight group or the no current smoker group. Serum ferritin level was an independent risk factor of incident fatty liver detected by ultrasonography even in non-obese, healthy Korean men. Increased serum ferritin levels appear to be an early predictor for incident fatty liver.
