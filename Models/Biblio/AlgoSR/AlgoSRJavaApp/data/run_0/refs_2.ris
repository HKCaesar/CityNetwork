AB  - A basic framework for the sensitivity analysis and continuous optimization of integrated land use/transportation model is proposed in this paper. It is shown that separate sensitivity analysis procedures for a land use model with exogenous travel costs and a transportation network with elastic demand can be combined to get a sensitivity analysis procedure for the integrated model. Sensitivity-analysis-based techniques can then be used for the optimal design of land use plans and transportation policies so that certain social surplus functions are optimized. The proposed method is illustrated with a residential location model with a congestible transportation network sub-model.

AB  - Integrated timber harvest and transportation planning problems can be modeled as 0-1 mixed integer programming problems, but initial computations led to large integrality gaps which cannot be overcome easily. In this paper we show how this situation can be substantially improved by a combination of techniques, such as: addition of logical inequalities, lifting of inequalities and careful selection of Branch-and-Bound branching priorities based on a consideration of double-contraction. We compare various combinations of tightening techniques in terms of number of (integer) variables and constraints, LP bound, number of nodes in the Branch-and-Bound tree and CPU time.

AB  - Abstract Integrated land-use and transportation forecasting models require large amounts of data to calibrate and estimate. Obtaining reliable datasets for these models can be one of the most cost-prohibitive and time-consuming stages of such an endeavor. The purpose of this paper is to present a case-study data development program that was able to successfully provide all of the needed data for the estimation and calibration of an integrated land-use and transportation forecasting model. The recently developed Cube Land model was implemented in the Montgomery (Alabama) Area Metropolitan Planning Organization with funding from the Alabama Department of Transportation. The data development program was fiscally and temporally constrained and replicates typical model development conditions in medium-sized metropolitan planning organizations. This case study presents findings demonstrating that in the US locally developed datasets combined with national data sources and ?off-the-shelf?, relatively low-cost but high-quality, purchasable datasets can be obtained in a relatively short amount of time and are sufficient to estimate and calibrate an integrated land-use and transportation forecasting model.\nAbstract Integrated land-use and transportation forecasting models require large amounts of data to calibrate and estimate.

AB  - This paper describes the results, to date, of an effort to integrate a land use model with a transportation network model for the purpose of analyzing the inter- relationships of transportation facility development and land development. In the system which has been developed each model provides input to, and receives feedbacks from, each other model. To the author's knowledge, the effort described here repre- sents the first successful attempt to develop and test an integrated model package involving these reciprocal relationships. The results obtained from preliminary runs of this package should be of considerable interest to both transportation planners and land use planners. With this integrated system it has been possible to observe the interrelationships, and in particular the feedbacks, between land use and levels of traffic on the networks. Preliminary results indicate that congested networks produce tendencies toward metropolitan centralization. Attempts to relieve congestion seem to produce metropolitan decentralization and increased travel which lead, in turn, to metropolitan sprawl and increased spread of congestion.

The UrbanSim model and the collaborative OPUS framework (Open Platform for Urban Simulation) that it has spawned have stimulated much original progress in this field. The object of this thematic issue of the Journal of Transport and Land Use is to report on this work and to illustrate the various ways UrbanSim has been adapted. However, this special issue is more than just a collection of progress reports. A central theme running through all the papers is that integrated land use-transportation modeling in Europe presents a series of challenges and demands not necessarily present in the United States context in which UrbanSim was developed. Thus, while the UrbanSim system can be technically adapted to European studies given the data and resources, the prevailing land-use transportation environment in Europe differs from the United States.

AB  - Due to additional trip production by land use development, the O-D travel costs between some O-D pairs may also change intuitively. This leads to positive and negative impacts on network users traveling between different O-D pairs. Therefore the equity issue about the benefit distribution gained from the land-use development problem is raised. This paper proposes an Equity based Land-Use Transportation Problem (ELUTP) which is intended to examine the benefit distribution among the network users and the resulting equity associated with land-use development problem in terms of the change of equilibrium O-D travel cost. In the resulting bi-level programming model, the upper level sub-problem maximizes traffic production incorporating equity constraints, while the lower level sub-problem is a combined trip distribution/assignment user equilibrium problem. Genetic algorithm based method is applied to test the models using an example network.

AB  - The practice of integrated land use and transportation modeling has improved in the past decade. Use of these models has steadily increased among U.S. metropolitan planning organizations and recently among state departments of transportation. This paper examines the secondary growth impacts of large, urban-edge developments in an integrated model to determine the existence and characteristics of induced land development (also called path dependency in the modeled land development process). The Sacramento, California, MEPLAN model is used to simulate the impact of large, urban-edge, basic sector developments on overall and industry-specific employment in the subject zone over a modeled 25-year period. Four types of basic sector development are considered: office and service, industrial and manufacturing, retail, and government. Ten sizes of each type were modeled, and each simulated development shares a common location and year of construction or occupancy. The study found that secondary employment draw was substantial for all sizes and types of projects, certain industries produced much larger secondary draws than did others, secondary growth increased with the size of the development and continued to have an impact in all future modeled years, and the relationship between initial development size and secondary growth is nonlinear in each development type. This significant, persistent secondary draw suggests that this model manifestu a key characteristic of path dependency in the location and building decisions in the model (i.e., a relatively small shift in basic employment can create new development "paths"). These findings yield recommendations for incorporating this work into integrated modeling research and practice.

AB  - Future changes in land Use in the coastal zone will be dominated by the effects of climate change. The major effect of climate change on the coastal zone will be clue to increasing sea level which, in combination with possible increases in the frequency and intensity of storms, will bring about: change in patterns of erosion and sedimentation increased risk of flooding change in the distribution and types of coastal habitats. The coastline has always been subject to change through erosion and other natural Processes. Climate change may speed this change. This will mean profound impacts on low-lying coastal areas over the next 50 years, particularly along the eastern coast of England. These physical changes in the coastal zone will occur alongside, and interact with. a variety of human impacts and drivers of change. Agricultural policy reform, and changes in production in response to this and to climate change, will alter coastal landscapes as well as sediment and nutrient inputs into coastal waters. Demographic change - an increasing UK population, who are on average older and who potentially have more leisure time - will be likely to bring about an increased demand for the recreational opportunities that the coast provides. This will mean more demand for land for housing and recreational facilities. A continuing trend of rising income levels may also fuel further demand for imported goods and hence the need for further port development, particularly in the south east of England. Coastal landscapes are also likely to be heavily impacted by the construction of renewable energy infrastructure, i.e. offshore wind farms and wave and tidal power projects.

A methodology for identifying a range of land use—transportation systems by a clustering technique with network and land use inputs was developed. Twenty neighborhoods from Orange County, California, were considered in this process. Three groups, or themes, were found to best represent the neighborhoods in the sample area: one each associated with the conventional definition of traditional and neotraditional neighborhood design (TND) and planned unit development (PUD) neighborhoods and one representing neighborhoods that blend characteristics of TND and PUD. Conventional measures of individual travel behavior were compared with an analysis of variance between the themes to identify significant differences, controlling for socioeconomic characteristics. Research results include the development of (a) a systematic methodology to identify a more explicit land use—transportation dimension, (b) an estimate of the potential effectiveness of design-oriented solutions to reduce automobile congestion by using the developed themes, and (c) a preliminary assessment of the extent to which development themes can be used to improve the current modeling framework.

Accordingly, the system provides detailed and easily accessible information on transportation projects in the region, as well as their interrelationships and impacts. By doing so, TELUS enables public-sector agencies to meet organizational, Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, state, and other mandates more effectively. The objectives are accomplished by providing the computer-based capability to analyze, sort, combine, and track transportation projects in or under consideration for a TIP; assessing the interrelationships among significant transportation projects; estimating the regional economic and land use effects of transportation projects; and presenting project information in an easily understood format, including geographic information system formats.

AB  - This paper presents the process of derivation and development of a spatial multinomial logit model and its application to a housing type choice problem. Over the past few years, a rela- tively small body of research was developed that tries to capture the spatial and temporal de- pendencies across decision-makers and alternatives. While temporal dependencies are often considered especially in dynamic models, there has been relatively little work in the literature on incorporating spatial dependencies into qualitative dependent variables and discrete choice models, leading to inconsistent estimates. Part of the reason is that space is in general more complex to deal with than time. The basic idea presented in this paper is that decision-makers may influence each other, resulting in correlated choice behaviour over space. In this paper, spatial dependency terms are implemented in a standard multinomial logit framework. The re- sults show that the spatial terms are statistically significant in the model and improve model fit

This research investigates the efficacy of using simulation in teaching the topic of transportation network growth through an experiment conducted at the Civil Engineering Department of the University of Minnesota. In the experiment, a network growth simulator program (SONG) was incorporated into a senior/graduate class in transportation system analysis. Results of the experiment show that the use of SONG effectively enhanced students' learning in terms of helping students develop in-depth understanding about the development process of network patterns, and helped them develop some aspects of judgment, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. However the use of SONG may have been more effective had some other barriers to learning been overcome.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the role of land use and transportation plans as policy instruments for promoting active community environments. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis using multilevel models to examine whether active community environment scores were associated with leisure and transportation-related physical activity (PA) and whether associations varied by household income. SETTING: 67 North Carolina counties SUBJECTS: Adults (n = 6694) from pooled 2000 and 2002 North Carolina Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) surveys. MEASURES: Active community environment scores, derived from a 2003 survey of planning directors, representing the presence of nonmotorized transportation improvements, mixed land use classification, and comprehensiveness of implementation tools. Dependent variables were self-reported PA measures from the BRFSS. Sociodemographic variables were derived from the 2000 U.S. Census of Population. RESULTS: After adjustment for sociodemographic factors, more favorable active community environment scores were significantly associated with leisure PA (p = .001), transportation PA (p < .01), bicycling (p < .05), walking 150 minutes/week (p < .001), and meeting PA recommendations (p < .0001). In stratified analyses, lower-income individuals (<$25, 000) living in high scoring counties were three times more likely to participate in transportation PA compared with those living in low scoring counties (95% confidence interval, 1.4, 7.3). CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies previously unexamined policy and institutional correlates of PA related to land use and transportation planning. Plans may provide a means to incorporate community support for active living into public policy.

RESULTS: After adjustment for sociodemographic factors, more favorable active community environment scores were significantly associated with leisure PA (p = .001), transportation PA (p < .01), bicycling (p < .05), walking 150 minutes/week (p < .001), and meeting PA recommendations (p < .0001). In stratified analyses, lower-income individuals (<$25, 000) living in high scoring counties were three times more likely to participate in transportation PA compared with those living in low scoring counties (95% confidence interval, 1.4, 7.3). CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies previously unexamined policy and institutional correlates of PA related to land use and transportation planning. Plans may provide a means to incorporate community support for active living into public policy.

AB  - Transportation planners and metropolitan planning organizations require up-to-date land-use information to allocate transportation resources and to forecast the location and type of growth within metropolitan areas and associated increases in transportation volumes. For rapidly changing areas, extant geographic databases may not contain current land-use information. Other layers in the GIS database have potential for aiding image-based procedures far updating land-use layers. Results from the fir st of two case studies suggest that land-use change detection using high spatial resolution imagery is useful for detecting individual change features, but that automatic delineation of these features yields imprecise boundaries, such that interactive delineation is likely to be required. Results from the second case study indicate that many GIS data layers maintained by metropolitan planning organizations provide useful information for determining current land use when combined with interactive identification of land-use category from high resolution image data.

AB  - This paper develops a log-linear regression approach to estimate missing data in a sparse origin–destination (O–D) matrix assuming the sampled or observed O–D trips follow a good gravity pattern. The approach is tested with randomly selected samples from the known portions of 1997, 2002, and 2007 US Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) O–D value and tonnage matrices and validated with 2007 US O–D tonnage matrix at the state level. The missing data are also estimated for the 2007 CFS tonnage matrix with the best intercept and coefficients obtained using all known entries of the matrix. The concept of the approach can be extended beyond the gravity model to any strong mathematical pattern embedded in the known set of a sparse O–D matrix to estimate its missing cells.

AB  - The common confusion of land cover and land use in many data sets is problematic for many data integration activities. This article proposes an approach for the separation of land cover and land use based on data primitives. Data primitives are those dimensions that describe at the most fundamental level the processes under investigation. In this case, they provide building blocks that allow land cover and land use to be separated. A series of data primitives were identified from the literature and applied to US National Land Cover Dataset (2001). Mapped outputs, separating the concepts of form (land cover) and function (land use), show the degree of land use, the degree of land cover and locations where the concepts of use and cover are confused. The separation of land cover and land use facilitates the integration of land data for environmental modelling and planning activities. The work promotes the need for land use and land cover to be maintained as distinct concepts in data collection activities.

AB  - A method is proposed that planners and stakeholders can use to select an optimal land use plan that balances the socioeconomic benefits and environmental costs of regional growth. It entails seven steps: (1) specifying alternative growth futures; (2) formulating land use policies to alleviate potential adverse environmental impacts of alternative futures; (3) evaluating socioeconomic and environmental impacts (outcomes) with land use policies and alternative futures; (4) using a multiple attribute utility function to score outcomes and rank land use plans based on those scores; (5) determining an optimal plan for stakeholders based on some decision criterion; (6) employing a conflict resolution method to resolve stakeholder disagreements about optimal plans; and (7) using passive adaptive management to determine whether an implemented plan remains optimal over time. The proposed method is demonstrated for a hypothetical case study that incorporates: (1) low, medium, and high future growth rates for major industries in a region; (2) unrestrictive, moderately restrictive, and highly restrictive land use policies that limit the location and density of residential and non-residential development; (3) economic output and habitat fragmentation attributes of outcomes; (4) a linear additive, multiple attribute utility function; (5) pro-development, neutral, and pro-environment stakeholder preferences for attributes; and (6) optimal plan selection based on the maximin principle. Results for the hypothetical case study indicate that the ranking of the three plans and the optimal plan differ across the three stakeholder groups, and the optimal collective plan varies depending on which conflict resolution method is used and whether the assessment is ex ante or ex post. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We consider a transportation network with a set of origins and a set of destinations. Given a set of budgets for the residential and employment developments, and network enhancement, the problem is one of allocating the resources within the system, so that the probability of overloading the links in the network is minimized. For the improved transportation system with new household and employment distribution patterns, a combined distribution and assignment model is used to map the land-use pattern to the link-loading pattern in the network. Assuming that the actual demand of each origin–destination (O–D) pair follows a certain distribution, the road users choose their destination and route in accordance with the user equilibrium principle that is based on the long-run perceived travel cost. Moreover, it is assumed that despite the short-term demand fluctuation, the O–D-link choice proportion remains unchanged for the choices of destination and route, and the stochastic demand of all O–D pairs are independent. Explicit formulae for the mean and variance of the traffic volume on each link are derived. Using the central limit theorem, the probability that the traffic volume does not exceed the link capacity can be estimated, from which we can calculate a network reliability index. This index represents the probability that all links in the network are within the respective capacities. The problem can be formulated as a bi-level program, in which the upper-level sub-program maximizes the network reliability index with respect to the residential and employment allocations and network enhancements, whereas the lower-level subprogram is the combined distribution and assignment model with long-run travel cost functions. The problem is solved by a genetic algorithm. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology.

AB  - The decade since the initiation of the Land-Use/Cover Change (LUCC) project in 1995 (see Chap. 1) has witnessed considerable advances in the field of modeling of land-use/cover change. The science plan of the project indicated that the major task would be the development of a new generation of land-use/cover change models capable of simulating the major socioeconomic and biophysical driving forces of land-use and land-cover change. In addition, these models were supposed to be able to handle interactions at several spatial and temporal scales. Recent publications indicate that the LUCC science community has successfully met this challenge and a wide range of advanced models, aiming at different scales and research questions, is now available (Briassoulis 2000; Agarwal et al. 2001; Veldkamp and Lambin 2001; Parker et al. 2003; Nagendra et al. 2004; Veldkamp and Verburg 2004; Verburg et al. 2004b; Verburg and Veldkamp 2005). One of the most important observations that can be made examining the range of available land-use/ cover change models is the wide variety of approaches and concepts underlying the models. This chapter intends to describe the variety of modeling approaches, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches and indicate the remaining challenges for the land-use science community. Not being able to discuss all individual models and approaches, we will focus on broad distinctions between approaches and discuss how modelers have dealt with a number of important aspects of the functioning of the landuse system. A land-use system is understood here as a type of land use with interrelated determining factors with strong functional relations with each other (see Fig. 1.2). These factors include a wide range of land-use influencing factors than can be biophysical, economic, social, cultural, political, or institutional. The discussion of modeling approaches in this chapter is illustrated with examples of models and results from selected research projects.

AB  - Transportation and land use interact with each other in a mutual and dynamic manner. Changes in transportation systems create new accessibility levels that influence land-use patterns. Land-use changes in turn modify activity and travel patterns, which induce further changes in transportation systems. In addition, transportation and land-use interaction is influenced by other ongoing dynamic processes in an urban system. Many theories and models have been developed to improve our understanding of the mutual effects between transportation and land use. However, it remains a challenge to identify and forecast transportation and land-use interaction in contemporary urban areas since the interplays between different processes occur at various spatial and temporal scales and it is difficult to isolate the effect of one process from the others. Due to the desire of implementing innovative transportation and/or land-use policies to help achieve sustainable development, transportation and land-use interaction are likely to continue receiving attention from policymakers. Although we may not be able to answer all of the questions related to transportation and land-use interaction in the near future, recent progress in related theoretical work, methodological improvements, and technological advancements have shown promising potential of gaining further understanding of this subject.

AB  - The relationships between land use and biodiversity are fundamental to understanding the links between people and their environment. Biodiversity can be measured in many ways. The concept covers not only the overall richness of species present in a particular area but also the diversity of genotypes, functional groups, communities, habitats and ecosystems there. As a result, the relationships between biodiversity in its broadest sense and land use can be complex and highly context dependent. Moreover, the relationships between them are often two-way, so that simple relationships between cause and effect can be difficult to identify. In some places, specific land uses or land management practices may be important in sustaining particular patterns of biodiversity. Elsewhere, the uses to which land can be put are highly dependent on the biodiversity resources present. The review will consider how changes in the quantity, quality and spatial configuration of different aspects of land use can impact on different components of biodiversity, and what direct and indirect factors might drive these changes. The need to distinguish between land cover and land use will be discussed in relation to the economic and social drivers of land use change. The review will also consider whether framing biodiversity objectives involves society in placing constraints upon the types of land use and management practice that are possible, and will consider such arguments in relation to assessments of the costs of biodiversity loss. It would seem that while considerable progress has been made in mapping out plausible futures for land use and biodiversity at global and regional scales, closer integration of modelling, scenario and field-based monitoring is needed to strengthen the evidence base available to decision makers. Challenges that face us include how we take account of the qualitative changes in land cover, and the impacts of such modifications on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Broader perspectives on the value of biodiversity and ecosystem services are also needed as the basis for developing adaptive and flexible approaches to policy and management.

AB  - Data on land use change in the UK and its consitutent nations is variable in scope and quality, but has improved in recent years. It shows that the popular image of cities spreading across the countryside is a false one. In fact most new housing is built within existing settlements or in small rural developments, whilst more crop and grazing land has been turned over to woodland in the past 25 years than into housing. It also shows that market forces, taxes and subsidies have a rapid effect on land use decisions by developers, farmers and others, for example on what type of housing to build, what crops to grow and whether to turn farmland into woodland.

AB  - Transit oriented development (TOD) presents a sustainable urban development strategy by creating an efficient integration of land use and public transit. A TOD planning model for the land use of urban rail station area was explored by means of a multiple objective mathematical programming model. Three objectives were considered: encouraging transit system volume, promoting livable communities, and balancing land use. The model can easily be solved by transforming it into a linear multi-programming problem. The Xujiahui rail rapid transit station area in Shanghai is chosen as case study to illustrate the model application and planning results. The result indicates that the model would be efficient in practice.

AB  - The majority of studies on Chinese urbanization have been focused on coastal areas, with little attention given to urban centers in the west. Western provinces, however, will unquestionably undergo significant urban change in the future as a result of the 'Go West' policy initiated in the 1990s. In this paper the authors examine the relationship between drivers of urban growth and land-use outcomes in Chengdu, capital of the western province of Sichuan, China. In the first part of this research, remotely sensed data are used to map changes in land cover in the greater Chengdu area and to investigate the spatial distribution of development with use of landscape metrics along seven urban-to-rural transects identified as key corridors of growth. Results indicate that the urbanized area increased by more than 350% between 1978 and 2002 in three distinct spatial trends: (a) near the urban fringe in all directions prior to 1990, (b) along transportation corridors, ring roads, and near satellite cities after 1990, and, finally, (c) infilling in southern and western areas (connecting satellite cities to the urban core) in the late 1990s. In the second part of this paper the authors connect patterns of growth with economic, land, and housing market reforms, which are explored in the context of urban planning initiatives. The results reveal that, physically, Chengdu is following trends witnessed in coastal cities of China, although the importance of various land-use drivers differs from that in the east (for example, in the low level of foreign direct investment to date). The information provided by the land-use analysis ultimately helped tailor policies and plans for better land management and reduced fragmentation of new development in the municipality

AB  - Density and land use mix are focused on as the two primary variables for characterization of land use in transportation research. As commonly constructed, these variables do not capture well actual development patterns on the ground, thus obscuring a potentially strong relationship between land use and transportation behavior. To overcome these limitations, parcel-level data and geographic information system software were used to identify and measure attributes of land use. These data are at a level of resolution that closely corresponds to the spatial distribution of development patterns. A method for location of concentrations of medium- to high-density housing and commercial development in suburban areas identified in previous research is described. The method includes the use of metrics derived from landscape ecology to model these development patterns and, specifically, their shapes and their functional and spatial

AB  - We consider a transportation network with a set of origins and a set of destinations. Given a set of budgets for the residential and employment developments, and network enhancement, the problem is one of allocating the resources within the system, so that the probability of overloading the links in the network is minimized. For the improved transportation system with new household and employment distribution patterns, a combined distribution and assignment model is used to map the land-use pattern to the link-loading pattern in the network. Assuming that the actual demand of each origin-destination (O-D) pair follows a certain distribution, the road users choose their destination and route in accordance with the user equilibrium principle that is based on the long-run perceived travel cost. Moreover, it is assumed that despite the short-term demand fluctuation, the O-D-link choice proportion remains unchanged for the choices of destination and route, and the stochastic demand of all O-D pairs are independent. Explicit formulae for the mean and variance of the traffic volume on each link are derived. Using the central limit theorem, the probability that the traffic volume does not exceed the link capacity can be estimated, from which we can calculate a network reliability index. This index represents the probability that all links in the network are within the respective capacities. The problem can be formulated as a bi-level program, in which the upper-level sub-program maximizes the network reliability index with respect to the residential and employment allocations and network enhancements, whereas the lower-level sub-program is the combined distribution and assignment model with long-run travel cost functions. The problem is solved by a genetic algorithm. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology.

AB  - We are developing a statewide urban growth model for California. It will be run in iteration with the California statewide travel model to evaluate major transportation improvement scenarios, such as freeway widenings and high speed rail. In addition, we will evaluate land use policies intended to provide for more affordable housing and for habitat protection. This model is uniquely capable of providing performance measures for total travel, travel delay, mode shares, economic development, wages, economic welfare, economic equity, rents paid by households and firms, energy use in vehicles and buildings, greenhouse gas emissions, vehicular air pollution, loss of agricultural lands, habitat loss, and erosion potential. We propose a framework for interpreting all of these data, based on recent advances in the theory of well-being for persons and for nations.

AB  - Transportation decisions clearly affect land-use patterns, and land-use decisions clearly affect transportation systems. Urban theorists have addressed the cyclical land-usetransportation relationship for many decades and economists have modeled it extensively. Field studies demonstrate what the economists have predicted and what many theorists have feared: that, in many ways, highways shape urban areas. Yet little of that knowledge has found its way into planning practice, and land-use planning and transportation planning remain separate decision-making processes. Now that Congress has mandated that transportation planners consider both land-use plans and the land-use impacts of their decisions, the literature of planning practice should draw on the theoretical and research literature and provide guidance to planners on how to manage the transportation-land-use cycle.

AB  - Problem: Since the late 1980s, U.S. metropolitan regions have increasingly engaged in a style of land use-transportation scenario planning that merges techniques borrowed from military and business strategic planning with long-range transportation systems planning and project-level alternatives analysis. Aside from occasional anecdotal descriptions, the effectiveness of such approaches in generating compact growth plans has not been evaluated comprehensively. Purpose: We analyzed a wide range of scenario planning studies to determine how far compact growth scenarios are predicted to reduce vehicular travel below existing trends. Methods: Using hierarchical modeling, we developed a regional vehicle-miles-traveled (VMT) model based on 85 scenarios in 23 planning studies from 18 metropolitan areas. Results and conclusions: Using coefficients from this model, we conservatively estimate that compact growth scenarios reduce VMT in 2050 by 17% below scenarios assuming a continuation of existing trends. Takeaway for practice: Existing transportation models remain largely insensitive to changes in land use and transportation policy. This must change for scenario planning to achieve its full potential. In the future, scenario planning should incorporate the best current knowledge about how global economic and environmental trends will affect regions.

Unlike other existing urban land use and transportation planning models in which a â€œfixed demandâ€  for services is assumed to be known at the zonal level of an urban area, zonal travel demand is endogenously determined together with link congestion costs, optimal amounts of production and resulting efficient densities of land uses, once the transportation network is given. Some characteristics of alternative solutions are demonstrated. The proposed model represents progress over previous efforts in combining land use-transportation problems since the travel choice as to origin, destination and routes as well as amounts of goods to be produced at the optimal density of land uses are integrated into a consistent mathematical programming framework.

AB  - Scenario analysis of urban dynamics from spatial land use models can support urban, planning and policy. An integrated modeling approach, linking assessment of urban spatial dynamics, was applied to the Santiago Metropolitan Area (SMA). The integrated land use change model combines, a logistic regression model, Markov chain, and cellular automata. This model was calibrated with data, from 1975 to 2010, and was used to make predictions for the years 2030 and 2045, using two datasets of, urban and non-urban explanatory variables. Urban change estimates showed the highest fit during the, model calibration phase. The true-positive proportion and standard Kappa value (κ) were of 99% and, 0.87 respectively when validating against an urban cover reference map from 2010. Urban growth was, equal to +27,000. ha (72%) for the period 1975-2010, and the city of Santiago is projected to, reach approximately 93,000. ha by 2045 (+43% from 2010). In the SMA the most important, urban growth pattern is peri-urban development, referring to widespread boundaries and higher, fragmentation in peripheral municipalities. Predictions for 2030 estimate that ~15% of the projected, urban expansion will occur outside the boundary set by the current Regulatory Plan proposal. These, results demonstrate the capacity of the integrated model to establish comparisons with urban plans, and its utility to explain both the amount and constraints of urban growth. The integrated approach of, urban dynamic assessment using land use modeling is useful for spatiotemporal representation of, distinct urban development forms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - RELU is a dynamic general equilibrium model of a metropolitan economy and its land use, derived by unifying in a theoretically valid way, models developed by one of the authors Anas (1982), Anas-Arnott (1991, 1997), Anas-Kim (1996), Anas-Xu (1999). RELU equilibrates floor space, land and labor markets, and the market for the products of industries, treating development (construction and demolition), spatial interindustry linkages, commuting, and discretionary travel. Mode choices and equilibrium congestion on the highway network are treated by unifying RELU with the TRAN algorithm of stochastic user equilibrium Anas-Kim (1990). The RELU-TRAN algorithm's performance for a stationary state is demonstrated for a prototype consisting of 4-building, 4-industry, 4-labor-type, 15-land-use-zone, 68-link-highway-network version of the Chicago MSA. The algorithm solves 656 equations in a special block-recursive convergent procedure by iterations nested within loops and loops within cycles. Runs show excellent and smooth convergence from different starting points, so that the number of loops within successive cycles continually decreases. The tests also imply a numerically ascertained unique stationary equilibrium solution of the unified model for the calibrated parameters.

AB  - This paper reports on the culmination of a two year project to facilitate “smart growth” planning in the Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area. Using a group model building process, representatives of key municipal entities and resource management agencies developed a model for examining the potential effects of changes in land use and transportation planning on air quality, traffic congestion, and other quality of life factors. The model and the process both contributed significantly to broadening systems thinking capacity in regional planning. The model supports system-based policy evaluation and the process created a common systems language among the more than 20 land use, transportation, and air quality planners in the group. The model represents regional links between population, transportation infrastructure, land use characteristics, and air pollution. Model analysis shows that the most powerful tool for achieving policy objectives is a combination of land use design and transportation infrastructure that reduces the average number of trips per day and distance per trip. This paper describes the model, results of the analysis, and effects of the group model building process on the participants.

AB  - Land use changes inevitably have impacts on travel costs and trip production. The impacts may be positive or negative to transportation users. Importantly, equity issues arise as the positive benefits and the negative ones may be unevenly distributed. This paper will propose an equity-based land use-transportation model, which examines the benefit distribution among transportation users as well as investigates equity concerns associated with the impact of land development on the equilibrium O-D travel cost. The study uses a bi-level programming model integrating equity issues into the travel demand model. The upper level sub-model maximizes traffic production with equity constraints, while the lower level sub-model addresses a combined trip distribution/assignment user equilibrium problem. Genetic algorithm based method is applied to solve the bi-level model.

A key innovation of the UPTown game developed at the University of Pretoria, South Africa, is the way in which the actions of both public-sector planners and private-sector real estate developers are simulated by students. This allows students to explore the problems of conflicting objectives and to discover the value of cooperative planning in the land use and transportation development process. The paper describes the background to and rationale for an integrated planning course, and it explains the game and simulation aspects in detail. Assessment of student performance showed that the game significantly enhanced the achievement of learning outcomes. Students who faced more complex and open-ended tasks performed better, reaching higher levels of competence earlier on in the game. The paper should be of value to educators who wish to develop new approaches, such as gaming simulation, to respond to contemporary engineering students' preferences for more active and social learning styles.

AB  - Over the last decades there has been intense focus on better understanding land-use-transportation relationships. One prominent research area within this nexus has examined whether urban structural characteristics, such as the balance of jobs and housing, impacts broader transportation patterns, particularly commuting outcomes. Researchers have sought to quantify relationships in comparative studies across space and time, without fully realizing the latter due to sparse data availability, mainly due to reliance on government census type products which often lack adequate temporal resolution. This research utilizes a relatively new database from the U.S. Census known as Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) to explore temporal commuting-land-use relationships. This database has a high degree of spatial and temporal resolution, with worker information reported annually from 2002 to 2010. Locations of workers, jobs, and their commute flows are resolved to the census block scale. We analyze LEHD data over a 9-year period from 2002 to 2010 for a mid-sized urban area. Estimation of several commuting and jobs-housing metrics lends insights into growth and decline that have occurred in the recent housing boom and bust, and their broader implications for travel patterns. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper details the development of a strategic-level modelling tool to evaluate the impacts of air quality and greenhouse gas mitigation strategies for urban freight. The model, known as STEAR-F (Strategic Tool for the Environmental Analysis of Road Freight) combines publicly available information on freight travel, fleet characteristics, and emission factors to provide estimates of total Greenhouse Gas (GHG) and non-GHG emissions. Following details of the model development and underlying assumptions, STEAR-F is applied to evaluate strategies currently under consideration in the Sydney region. These include accelerated vehicle scrappage programs, diesel vehicle retrofit programs, Low Emission Zones, alternative fuel programs, and educational/information programs focused on driver behaviour, new technologies and proactive vehicle maintenance.

AB  - This paper examines the land use policies implemented in the city of Curitiba, Brazil, from 1965 to the present, Curitiba used land use planning, the hierarchy of the road network, an economic development policy and public transport to coordinate the parameters for the location and density of homes, work, recreation, services and commerce. The city was planned as an integrated structure for living and working, Curitiba was also the fastest-growing city in Brazil during the 1970s, which demonstrates that the above approach has been successful as an effective instrument to control and direct rapid urban growth while contributing to sound environmental management. The paper describes the integration of land use/transportation policies and the instruments that contributed to its enforcement and attempts to draw selected lessons from the experience.

AB  - The need to mitigate the repercussions of urban sprawl over the last decades triggered the use of systematic urban plans that encompass land use, transportation and environmental dimensions. These plans aim at forecasting housing demand and analyzing the impacts governmental policy programs may have on urban development. A considerable number of integrated urban models have been developed and used in the regional transportation planning. Within this context, the history and future of integrated transportation and land-use urban models are discussed and indicated. The review of these models embarks on the process of building the future integrated urban model.

Planners need practical tools to consider the impact of development on pedestrian safety, a key requirement for the promotion of walking. Simple bivariate models have been used to predict changes in vehicle-pedestrian injury collisions based on changes in traffic volume. We describe the development of a multivariate, area-level regression model of vehicle-pedestrian injury collisions based on environmental and population data in 176 San Francisco, California census tracts. Predictor variables examined included street, land use, and population characteristics, including commute behaviors. The final model explained approximately 72% of the systematic variation in census-tract vehicle-pedestrian injury collisions and included measures of traffic volume, arterial streets without transit, land area, proportion of land area zoned for neighborhood commercial and residential-neighborhood commercial uses, employee and resident populations, proportion of people living in poverty and proportion aged 65 and older. We have begun to apply this model to predict area-level change in vehicle-pedestrian injury collisions associated with land use development and transportation planning decisions.

Major metropolitan areas in each country have seen rising motorization, increasing congestion, and privatization of transportation services. Devolution of transportation planning responsibility has occurred; to a lesser degree, funding responsibility has been devolved from central to regional/local government. New Zealand pushed privatization harder in the 1990s than either Chile or California. While no dominant model of transportation planning has emerged, metropolitan-level planning has become more prominent and autonomous in each country studied. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Although there are only a limited number of rigorous research papers focussed specifically on land use perceptions, there is an extensive literature on: environmental attitudes in general and urban growth in particular, as well as on the land use perceptions of farmers and on public perceptions about the use of land for the production of food and raw materials. A number of key themes emerge. First, the urban public are resistant to urban growth and have an ingrained and deep attachment to 'traditional' and romanticised visions of rural land use. Second, farmers, the main managers of land use, have proved resistant to concepts of multifunctional land use. Third, there is a perception gap between the practice of food production as a damaging land use exercise and consumer ignorance about the realities of how food and other raw materials are produced. However, consumers support the ideas of farmers being paid to use their land in a more environmentally friendly way. Fourth, there is a value-action gap between people's perceptions of the land use damage they are doing and their lack of willingness to actually change their behaviours. The drivers behind these perceptions are likely to change as carbon reduction policies begin to impact. So the paper concludes with a discussion about future perceptions and possible behavioural change. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - This study developed models that relate trip lengths to the land-use characteristics at the trip ends (both production and attraction ends). Separate models were developed by trip purpose. The results indicate several statistically significant and intuitively reasonable effects of land-use patterns. High residential densities and a good mix of complementary land uses are associated with shorter trips. Larger establishments attract longer trips, and the lengths of home-based other trips decrease with an increase in the number of convenient commercial land- use parcels in the neighborhood. The connectivity provided by the roadway network and the urban form of the area (measured in terms of number of intersections and cul-de-sacs) affect trip lengths. In addition to the local land-use characteristics, trip lengths also vary significantly by the location of the neighborhood within the region. All these results hold even after controlling for several trip and traveler characteristics. The models have been implemented in a spreadsheet program for use in assessing the transportation impacts of new land developments.

As a specification, it can be treated as an API for archetypes. It is recommended that the openEHR ADL document 4 be read in conjunction with this document, since it contains a detailed explanation of the semantics of archetypes, and many of the examples are more obvious in ADL, regardless of whether ADL is actually used with the object model presented here or not.

AB  - A land use and transportation interaction model was developed for the Sacramento, California, region, using the MEPLAN framework. The model represents land markets directly together with location-choice processes of different industry and household categories and the interactions among them. These resulting economic interactions lead to trip matrixes that are assigned to a multimodal, capacity-restrained transportation network, generating travel times and disutilities that influence the location-choice process in the period from 1990 to 2015. A range of different policy options is simulated for that period. Five different scenarios are compared with a trend scenario, three representing different long- and short-term government transportation supply scenarios, one representing incentives and disincentives to encourage land use patterns complementary to an improved transit system, and one combining the land-incentive scenario with higher prices for private vehicle use. The scenario predictions differ in mode choice, firm location, residential location, development patterns, vehicle kilometers traveled, and land rents. Various land uses are seen to be bidding against each other, and the differences in spatial arrangements between scenarios are quite complex and demonstrate the richness of the model. Certain changes take time to develop, demonstrating the need for a long-term approach to planning.

AB  - Over the past few years the Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC) has worked to advance its land use forecasting practices through the development and implementation of the UrbanSim land use model. More recently, PSRC has begun the integration of its transportation models with the land use models, employing feedback from each set of models to the others. This paper describes sensitivity testing conducted to better understand the correlation between the location choices of households and jobs to changes in land accessibility resulting from various different characterizations of a future transportation system. Through this integration a major advance in the agency's modeling approach has been achieved; thus providing a more robust method of assessing how land use and transportation systems co-evolve. A review of literature and practice yields an expectation of modest changes to land uses in response to incremental changes in transportation systems. The importance of many other factors besides accessibility is stressed in the literature. The application of the integrated models revealed an intuitively appealing and consistent relationship between accessibility and site values, but resulted in much more modest and difficult to interpret response in terms of changing locations of households and jobs. Taken together the findings appear generally consistent with theoretical expectations.

AB  - This paper presents a system dynamics approach to simultaneous land use/transportation system performance modeling. A model is designed based on the causality functions and feedback loop structure between a large number of physical, socioeconomic, and policy variables. The model system consists of 7 sub-models: population, migration of population, household, job growth-employment-land availability, housing development, travel demand, and traffic congestion level. The model is formulated in DYNAMO simulation language, and tested on a data set from Montgomery County, MD. In Part I: Methodology, the overall approach and the structure of the model system is discussed and the causal-loop diagrams and major equations are presented. In Part II: Application, the model is calibrated and tested with data from Montgomery County, MD. Least square method and overall system behavior are used to estimate the model parameters. The model is fitted with the 1970-80 data and validated with the 1980-1990 data. Robustness and sensitivities with respect to input parameters such as birth rate or regional economy growth are analyzed. The model performance as a policy analysis tool is also examined by predicting the year by year impacts of highway capacity expansion on land use and transportation system performance. While this is a first attempt in using dynamic system simulation modeling in simultaneous treatment of land use and transportation system interactions, and model development and application are limited to some extent due to data availability, the results clearly indicate that the proposed method is a promising approach in dealing with complex urban land use/transportation modeling.

AB  - This study presents an alternative method for estimating gravity models by multiple linear regression that is based on proxy variables, thus circumventing the endogeneity problems arising when least-squares estimators are used. The proxy variable approach generates consistent estimators for a gravity model without endogeneity bias. The presence of endogeneity is tested for using statistical tests developed specifically for our application. We conclude that proxy variables eliminate the endogeneity and produce consistent estimators in gravity models estimated using least squares. We also find, however, that endogeneity bias has no significant impact either on gravity model prediction or on urban transportation system planning processes based on such models. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In recent years, the use of visioning processes and scenario-planning tools for developing regional land-use scenarios has become rather common. Typically, visioning is performed as a cooperative, inclusive process among business owners, community residents, interest groups, and local officials, and results in broad goals and principles which can guide future policies and plans. This is a very different approach than a land-use modeling process, which is typically generated by technical experts and results in a set of probable future trends and indicators which can guide the implementation of growth management strategies. The scenario-planning tools typically used for visioning processes are designed to generate and compare potential and preferred future development scenarios based on stakeholder values and preferences, whereas land-use models are used to predict likely future development patterns based on mathematical equations, reflecting historical trends, and market forces. Consequently, direct comparisons of results for the two methods are not really relevant. However, it is important to understand how the two approaches differ and that both offer their own relative advantages from a planning perspective. In an effort to better appreciate what each approach offers, this paper compares and contrasts these two methods, featuring the Austin metropolitan statistical area as a case study. The preferred vision, produced by the Envision Central Texas organization, offers the greatest potential for public involvement in identifying regional development goals for the future. The land-use models have a strong theoretical foundation and allow for interactions with a transportation model. Moreover, the land-use models have the potential to identify key strategies that can be used in achieving the region's goals. Thus, the combination of these two approaches seems to offer the greatest opportunities for planners to achieve a future that accommodates all stakeholders.  2008 ASCE.

AB  - RELU is a dynamic general equilibrium model of a metropolitan economy and its land use, derived by unifying in a theoretically valid way, models developed by one of the authors [ Anas (1982) , Anas-Arnott (1991, 1997) , Anas-Kim (1996) , Anas-Xu (1999) ]. RELU equilibrates floor space, land and labor markets, and the market for the products of industries, treating development (construction and demolition), spatial interindustry linkages, commuting, and discretionary travel. Mode choices and equilibrium congestion on the highway network are treated by unifying RELU with the TRAN algorithm of stochastic user equilibrium [ Anas-Kim (1990) ]. The RELU-TRAN algorithm's performance for a stationary state is demonstrated for a prototype consisting of 4-building, 4-industry, 4-labor-type, 15-land-use-zone, 68-link-highway-network version of the Chicago MSA. The algorithm solves 656 equations in a special block-recursive convergent procedure by iterations nested within loops and loops within cycles. Runs show excellent and smooth convergence from different starting points, so that the number of loops within successive cycles continually decreases. The tests also imply a numerically ascertained unique stationary equilibrium solution of the unified model for the calibrated parameters. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study examines the impact of uncertainty in the land use component of a partially integrated land use-transportation modeling system called UrbanSim. Outputs from the land use model (LUM) act as inputs for a traditional 4-step travel demand model (TDM), and travel times from the traffic-assignment stage of the TDM are fed forward into the subsequent years LUM. This work examines the propagation of uncertainty across model stages as well as at each model stage over time. A factorized design approach is used to model uncertainty in demographic inputs (which include aggregate growth rates and mobility rates) to the land use model, as well as uncertainty in various model parameters. The results suggest that while several model inputs may affect model outputs in the short run, only those inputs that have a cumulative effect are likely to have a significant impact on outputs in the long run. The results also suggest that uncertainty in model outputs may increase for the first few years for which the model is run, as modified inputs send shocks through the urban system. However, the level of uncertainty appears to come down in later years, as households, jobs, and developers respond to changed input conditions

AB  - This study examines the impact of uncertainty in the land use component of a partially integrated land use-transportation modeling system called UrbanSim. Outputs from the land use model (LUM) act as inputs for a traditional 4-step travel demand model (TDM), and travel times from the traffic-assignment stage of the TDM are fed forward into the subsequent years LUM. This work examines the propagation of uncertainty across model stages as well as at each model stage over time. A factorized design approach is used to model uncertainty in demographic inputs (which include aggregate growth rates and mobility rates) to the land use model, as well as uncertainty in various model parameters. The results suggest that while several model inputs may affect model outputs in the short run, only those inputs that have a cumulative effect are likely to have a significant impact on outputs in the long run. The results also suggest that uncertainty in model outputs may increase for the first few years for which the model is run, as modified inputs send shocks through the urban system.

AB  - The effects of land use and transportation policies on emissions, ozone concentrations, and a metric for population exposure were investigated for Austin, Texas. Three distinct transportation and land use scenarios were examined with a gravity-based land use model and a standard travel demand model: a business-as-usual scenario, a road pricing policy that included a flat-rate carbon-based tax and congestion pricing of all Austin-area freeways, and an urban growth boundary policy. Two scenarios, a business-as-usual scenario and a flat-rate carbon-based tax and congestion pricing policy, were also examined with a novel, parcel-level land use change and land use intensity model and a standard travel demand model. Transportation and land use policies were predicted to have substantial effects on travel and on emissions of ozone precursors. Emissions of ozone precursors decreased markedly for all 2030 scenarios because of the implementation of more stringent federal motor vehicle emission control programs. Transportation and land use policies were predicted to lead to greater reductions of emissions of ozone precursors relative to the business-as-usual scenario. The effects of such policies on ozone concentrations and population exposure vary. Lower exposure was predicted for the road pricing scenarios, but a penalty appeared to exist in the form of relatively higher exposure predicted for the urban growth boundary on some days. This analysis indicates the potential complexity of planning for urban growth and equity and the need for integrated modeling and policy evaluation efforts.

AB  - Future changes in land Use in the coastal zone will be dominated by the effects of climate change. The major effect of climate change on the coastal zone will be clue to increasing sea level which, in combination with possible increases in the frequency and intensity of storms, will bring about: change in patterns of erosion and sedimentation increased risk of flooding change in the distribution and types of coastal habitats. The coastline has always been subject to change through erosion and other natural Processes. Climate change may speed this change. This will mean profound impacts on low-lying coastal areas over the next 50 years, particularly along the eastern coast of England. These physical changes in the coastal zone will occur alongside, and interact with. a variety of human impacts and drivers of change. Agricultural policy reform, and changes in production in response to this and to climate change, will alter coastal landscapes as well as sediment and nutrient inputs into coastal waters. Demographic change - an increasing UK population, who are on average older and who potentially have more leisure time - will be likely to bring about an increased demand for the recreational opportunities that the coast provides. This will mean more demand for land for housing and recreational facilities. A continuing trend of rising income levels may also fuel further demand for imported goods and hence the need for further port development, particularly in the south east of England. Coastal landscapes are also likely to be heavily impacted by the construction of renewable energy infrastructure, i.e. offshore wind farms and wave and tidal power projects.

The nature of the relationship between land use and transportation is examined briefly in terms of empirical evidence and the results from modeling exercises. Two studies that the use of such models and that are being carried out in Britain are examined. Despite these and some convincing arguments by expers, there is little evidence of widespread use of such models. A number of current policy issues are discussed, and then a set of policy instruments that can be used to meet the policy objectives are identified. Evidence on the ability of land use transportation models to represent the impacts of the policy instruments is presented. It is shown how such models can contribute significantly in some areas of policy analsys, for example, reducing congestion and energy use, but can contribute very little to the objective of moving toward a market economy.

AB  - Vehicle growth in developing nations is increasing rapidly, making it necessary for these nations to address the transportation and environmental impacts of on-road mobile sources. To estimate the air quality impact of their fleet, many nations have adopted modified versions of U.S.- or European-based emissions models or factors. In most cases, these models can lead to significant errors in emissions estimates. To address this problem, a new on-road mobile source emissions model designed for use in developing countries has been developed, called the International Vehicle Emissions (IVE) Model. The IVE model was developed jointly by researchers at the International Sustainable Systems Research Center and the University of California at Riverside. The IVE model uses local vehicle technology distributions, power-based driving factors, vehicle soak distributions, and meteorological factors to tailor the model to the local situation. In addition, an intensive two-week field study was designed to collect the necessary fleet and activity data to populate the model with critical local information. The IVE model along with the field study process have proven to be highly effective in providing an improved estimate of mobile source emissions in an urban area and allows the effective analysis of local policy options. The studies have served to transfer tools and knowledge on the process of creating and improving mobile source inventories in an efficient manner. The rational behind the development of the model, development and application of the field studies, overview of the results to date, and planned next steps are described in this paper.

AB  - Transportation congestion is reaching intolerable levels in many urban and suburban areas in the U S. Reliance upon traditional responses, such as transit and new highway capacity, is not working -- especially in suburban areas. Although methods for dealing with suburban congestion are often different, there are a number of common features that must be considered in developing short term as well as more permanent and long lasting solutions. In proposing short term solutions, a "Menu of Actions" is described. It includes transportation actions (the traditional transit and transportation management options) where there are opportunities for getting more out of the existing systems; land use/growth management actions which will result in more rational land use-transportation interactions; financial incentives, to encourage or discourage appropriate actions; more comprehensive and systematic land use and transportation planning; and the organizational and institutional actions required to implement rational solutions. While the "Mann of Actions" provides a broad array of possible actions to provide relief in the short run, over time the growth in traffic is likely to outpace their effectiveness. Consequently, longer term and often more difficult solutions must be considered and implemented as appropriate. They could include changes in land use development and land use management policies; changes in lifestyle and business practices; improvements through technological innovation; changes in the traditional ways of providing transportation services; and greatly expanded research and development.

AB  - In traditional travel forecasting models, a limited set of attributes are used to describe transit utility. The transit access environment is one of the characteristics of the travel experience often ignored by the models in use today. A quantitative approach to incorporating the effects of the transit access environment into transportation planning models is presented. A measure called the transit friendliness factor, which is defined as a function of the characteristics of the area surrounding a transit stop, is proposed. These characteristics include the quality of the pedestrian facilities, the character of nearby streets, the presence of amenities at the stop, and the proximity to potential destinations. A method for evaluating both the existing and the future value of the transit friendliness factor is described. Application of the proposed approach is illustrated by its successful implementation in the mode choice model used in a study for the Triangle Transit Authority in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. In conclusion, the lessons learned and suggested future applications are discussed.

AB  - A linear programming model is set forth for maximizing a vector of final demand deliveries under both regional production constraints and transportation network constraints. The model is essentially designed to study short-run effects, and hence no provision is made for the expansion of either industrial or transportation capacities. Within available capacities, however, the location of production is chosen so as to maximize final demand deliveries. A rough dynamic version of the model is presented as well as an algorithm for reaching an approximation of the optimum solution. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Benchmarking of rail firms has become a matter of substantial interest and many authors have emphasised the importance of transaction costs in regard to assessing the desirability of vertical separation. However, due to data and methodological limitations, previous rail efficiency studies have been unable to explicitly analyse the role that transaction cost measures play in determining the relative efficiency performance of different rail firms or rail systems. This paper incorporates recently produced measures of transaction costs into a two-stage bootstrapped data envelopment analysis (DEA), applied to a sample of 43 Swedish, German and British train operating firms. In the first stage, the number of transaction staff is included as a separate (physical) input within the DEA. This is followed by a second-step Tobit regression which seeks to evaluate the impact of institutional (vertical separation and type of operation), environmental (competition) and transactional (monetary values of transaction costs) factors on technical efficiency. The results of the analysis show that transactional factors are more important in determining technical efficiency than institutional factors and the opening-up of competition.

AB  - A new approach to regional land use and transportation planning, which uses a genetic algorithm as an integrated optimization tool, is presented. The approach is illustrated by applying it to the Wasatch Front Metropolitan Region, which consists of four counties in the state of Utah. This genetic algorithm-based approach was applied earlier to the twin cities of Provo and Orem in Utah, but here it is adapted to regional planning. Three issues make regional planning particularly difficult: (a) individual cities have significant planning autonomy, (b) the search space of possible plans is immense, and (c) preferences between competing objectives vary among stakeholders. The approach used here addresses the first issue by the way the problem is formulated. The second issue is addressed with a genetic algorithm. Such algorithms are particularly well suited to problems with large search spaces. The third issue is addressed by using a multiobjective fitness function in the genetic algorithm. It was found that a genetic algorithm could produce a set of nondominated future land use scenarios and street plans for a region, from which regional planners can make a selection. Execution of the algorithm to produce 100 plans per generation for 100 generations took about 4 days with a high-end personal computer. Interesting trends for reducing change and traffic congestion were discovered.

This paper summarizes the transportation and land use approaches that states have included in their climate action plans to date. Transportation and land use sector options are generally organized into three main categories: vehicle technology, fuels, and travel activity/land use. This paper adds a fourth category: vehicle operations to acknowledge that important mitigation options include how drivers operate their vehicles. Annual greenhouse gas reduction potential in 2012 and 2020 and cost effectiveness values are provided.

AB  - A number of tools have been developed to support the evaluation of intelligent transportation system (ITS) alternatives. However, the methodologies and some associated parameters in these tools were developed and selected before widespread deployments of ITSs. Significant experience gained with ITS in recent years warrants a new assessment of the evaluation methodologies and parameters of these systems. There are also advantages to incorporating the evaluation of ITS deployments as part of existing regional demand forecasting modeling environments rather than using external tools to perform this functionality. This paper discusses the development and implementation of a tool and methodologies to estimate the benefits and costs of these systems as part of a travel demand forecasting modeling environment. It also presents an application of the developed tool to evaluate two of the most widely deployed types of ITS: incident management and advanced traveler information systems. Case study results indicate that the methodologies developed in this study can be used to assess ITS deployments.

AB  - In this paper, two research approaches to specify the relation between land use types and their explanatory factors are applied to the same modelling framework. The two approaches are used to construct land suitability maps, which are used as inputs in two model applications. The first is an inductive approach that uses regression analysis. The second applies a theoretical, actor decision framework to derive relations deductively using detailed field data. Broadly speaking, this classification coincides with the distinction between empirical and theoretical models and the distinction between deriving process from pattern and pattern from process. The two modelling approaches are illustrated by a scenario analysis for a case study in a municipality in the Philippines. Goodness-of-fit of the deductive approach in predicting current land use is slightly lower compared to the inductive approach. Resulting land use projections from the modelling exercise for the two approaches differ in 15 percent of the cells, which is caused by differences in the specification of the suitability maps. The paper discusses the assumptions underlying the two approaches as well as the implications for the applicability of the models in policy-oriented research. The deductive approach describes processes explicitly and can therefore better handle discontinuities in land use processes. This approach allows the user to evaluate a wide range of scenarios, which can also include new land use types. The inductive approach is easily reproducible by others but cannot guarantee causality. Therefore, the inductive approach is less suitable to handle discontinuities or additional land use types, but is well able to rapidly identify hotspots of land use change. It is concluded that both approaches have their advantages and drawbacks for different purposes. Generally speaking, the inductive approach is applicable in situations with relatively small land use changes, without introduction of new land use types, whereas the deductive approach is more flexible. The choice of modelling approach should therefore be based on the research and policy questions for which it is used. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The relationships between land use and biodiversity are fundamental to understanding the links between people and their environment. Biodiversity can be measured in many ways. The concept covers not only the overall richness of species present in a particular area but also the diversity of genotypes, functional groups, communities, habitats and ecosystems there. As a result, the relationships between biodiversity in its broadest sense and land use can be complex and highly context dependent. Moreover, the relationships between them are often two-way, so that simple relationships between cause and effect can be difficult to identify. In some places, specific land uses or land management practices may be important in sustaining particular patterns of biodiversity. Elsewhere, the uses to which land can be put are highly dependent on the biodiversity resources present. The review will consider how changes in the quantity, quality and spatial configuration of different aspects of land use can impact on different components of biodiversity, and what direct and indirect factors might drive these changes. The need to distinguish between land cover and land use will be discussed in relation to the economic and social drivers of land use change. The review will also consider whether framing biodiversity objectives involves society in placing constraints upon the types of land use and management practice that are possible, and will consider such arguments in relation to assessments of the costs of biodiversity loss. It would seem that while considerable progress has been made in mapping out plausible futures for land use and biodiversity at global and regional scales, closer integration of modelling, scenario and field-based monitoring is needed to strengthen the evidence base available to decision makers. Challenges that face us include how we take account of the qualitative changes in land cover, and the impacts of such modifications on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Broader perspectives on the value of biodiversity and ecosystem services are also needed as the basis for developing adaptive and flexible approaches to policy and management.

AB  - An interval-parameter inter-community traffic planning model {(ICTPM)} is developed for supporting vehicle emissions management under uncertainty. With integrating interval-parameter and mixed-integer linear programming within a general optimization framework, the {ICTPM} can address uncertainties of traffic structure and vehicle emissions related to system costs and capacity expansion decisions. Another advantage of the proposed model is that decision variables can be obtained quickly, which make it applicable to complex traffic problems. The {ICTPM} is then applied to Wuhan City, China to demonstrate its applicability in the field of inter-community vehicle emissions management. In this study, one reference case and a scenario are provided for three planning periods. The results indicate that the {ICTPM} can provide strategies for authorities to deal with the issues of sustainable transportation system.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to gain insight into the anthropogenic forcing of geomorphic systems, specifically how nineteenth century land-use changes impacted watershed hydrologic, upland erosional, and sediment delivery subsystems of Southern Appalachian headwater catchments. Identification and analysis of the timing and rate of change in these subsystems, and the reestablishment of presettlement conditions, were used to address landscape sensitivity and watershed inheritance issues in a region undergoing population expansion and development. Archival research was used to reconstruct concurrent land-use changes in the catchments of two nineteenth century water-powered mills. Changes in the physical properties of mill pond sediments including, organic content, particle size distribution, and magnetic susceptibility, were used to interpret trends in sediment source during the span of mill operation. Interpolation of augering and coring data was used to determine mill pond sediment mass and pond capacity. Hillslope hydrologic change occurred almost immediately following land conversion. Upland erosion began with the removal of A-horizon fines, and progressed with the removal of A-horizon coarse particulates, and then B-horizon particulates. Change from one source category to another was punctuated by high flow events signifying an integration of human activity and climate in the changing of system boundary conditions

AB  - Error and uncertainty can be found in every stage of travel and land use modeling. Data errors and uncertainties in socioeconomic forecasts are largely ignored in many model calibration and validation exercises. Uncertainty in these models is passed from submodel to submodel and across model years thus producing a propagation of error over time. The practice of reporting the outputs of these models' as point estimates ignores uncertainty and can portray a level of accuracy far beyond the models' actual abilities. The purpose of this study is to interject uncertainty into the inputs of a fully integrated land use and transportation forecasting model, monitor the impacts of uncertainty on model's outputs, and determine which sources of uncertainty have the largest impact on these outputs. Of the several sources of uncertainty examined here, the commercial trip generation rates have the largest impact on model outputs. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a system dynamics approach to simultaneous land use/transportation system performance modeling. A model is designed based on the causality functions and feedback loop structure between a large number of physical, socioeconomic, and policy variables. The model system consists of 7 sub-models: population, migration of population, household, job growth-employment-land availability, housing development, travel demand, and traffic congestion level. The model is formulated in DYNAMO simulation language, and tested on a data set from Montgomery County, MD. In Part I: Methodology, the overall approach and the structure of the model system is discussed and the causal-loop diagrams and major equations are presented. In Part II: Application, the model is calibrated and tested with data from Montgomery County, MD. Least square method and overall system behavior are used to estimate the model parameters. The model is fitted with the 1970-80 data and validated with the 1980-1990 data. Robustness and sensitivities with respect to input parameters such as birth rate or regional economy growth are analyzed. The model performance as a policy analysis tool is also examined by predicting the year by year impacts of highway capacity expansion on land use and transportation system performance. While this is a first attempt in using dynamic system simulation modeling in simultaneous treatment of land use and transportation system interactions, and model development and application are limited to some extent due to data availability, the results clearly indicate that the proposed method is a promising approach in dealing with complex urban land use/transportation modeling.

AB  - A method for optimal transmission network expansion planning is presented. The transmission network is modelled as a transportation network. The problem is solved using hierarchical Benders decomposition in which the problem is decomposed into master and slave subproblems. The master subproblem models the investment decisions and is solved using a branchand- bound algorithm. The slave subproblem models the network operation and is solved using a specialised linear program. Several alternative implementations of the branch-and-bound algorithm have been tested. Special characteristics of the transmission expansion problem have been taken into consideration in these implementations. The methods have been tested on various test systems available in the literature.

Specifically, an idealized abstract example of the interactions between two homogeneous regions was studied with respect to various issues related to land use and transportation planning. The study took the form of systems of simple differential equations. Each equation represents the rate of change of either the land use or the transportation condition of a region. Investigation with the two-region model suggested a possibility of spatial and temporal fluctuations under certain planning conditions. By examining the conditions underlying the model equations, planning and developmental practices that may cause system instabilities were identified and discussed.

AB  - We consider a transportation network with a set of origins and a set of destinations. Given a set of budgets for the residential and employment developments, and network enhancement, the problem is one of allocating the resources within the system, so that the probability of overloading the links in the network is minimized. For the improved transportation system with new household and employment distribution patterns, a combined distribution and assignment model is used to map the land-use pattern to the link-loading pattern in the network. Assuming that the actual demand of each origin-destination (O-D) pair follows a certain distribution, the road users choose their destination and route in accordance with the user equilibrium principle that is based on the long-run perceived travel cost. Moreover, it is assumed that despite the short-term demand fluctuation, the O-D-link choice proportion remains unchanged for the choices of destination and route, and the stochastic demand of all O-D pairs are independent. Explicit formulae for the mean and variance of the traffic volume on each link are derived. Using the central limit theorem, the probability that the traffic volume does not exceed the link capacity can be estimated, from which we can calculate a network reliability index. This index represents the probability that all links in the network are within the respective capacities. The problem can be formulated as a bi-level program, in which the upper-level sub-program maximizes the network reliability index with respect to the residential and employment allocations and network enhancements, whereas the lower-level subprogram is the combined distribution and assignment model with long-run travel cost functions. The problem is solved by a genetic algorithm. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Effective management of interfaces between procurement, supply, production and distribution for higher efficiency in the supply chain is an important issue in global manufacturing, where the synchronization of production and transportation planning represents important savings in operational costs. This paper focuses on the synchronization of production planning and transportation planning in a production distribution network, where transportation is subcontracted to a professional transportation enterprise (PTE) for vehicle-hiring. Dynamic and flexible numbers of vehicles are used to cater for fast changing market demands. Thus, the number of vehicles to be hired is viewed from the planning point of view as an operational decision considered simultaneously with production and transportation planning. A mathematical model - SPTP/MTDS - for synchronized production and transportation planning under multiple times and direct shipping strategy (MTDS) is discussed, and a Lagrange relaxation decomposition-based two layer decision procedure (LRD-TLDP) is developed. By introducing artificial decision variables and Lagrange multipliers, SPTP/MTDS is decomposed into a production decision sub-problem (SPTP-PD), and a distribution decision sub-problem (SPTP-DD). A priority-based assignment heuristic and a partial chain-based genetic algorithm are developed to solve SPTP-PD and SPTP-DD, respectively. An illustration of the application of the model in an electronic appliance manufacturing enterprise in China is presented.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to examine the relationship between the availability of transportation infrastructure and services and the pattern of house prices in an urban area and to assess whether public investment in transportation can modify residential property values. This study was developed for the Lisbon, Portugal, metropolitan area (LMA) as part of a broader study that intends to develop new value-capture financing schemes for public transportation in the LMA. The paper focuses on three central municipalities in Portugal (Amadora, Lisbon, and Odivelas), where these effects could be more easily measured because of the existence of a significant variability of public transportation services. The paper tries to determine, with different spatial hedonic pricing models, the extent to which access to transportation infrastructure currently is capitalized into house prices and isolates the influence of three different transportation infrastructures: metro, rail, and road. The results suggest that the proximity to one or two metro lines leads to significant property value changes. Results further indicate that the classic hedonic price model (ordinary least-squares estimation) leads to similar coefficient values of the local accessibility dummy variables compared with the spatial lag model and thus provides a steady basis to forecast the property value changes derived from transportation investment for the study area in the absence of a significant property value database.

The models are developed on the field data collected during the planned experimentation by using full factorial plan. The values of input variables are changed for generating the actual values of dependent variables. The author in his earlier papers of formulation of experimental models, described in details the independent and dependent variables and the methodology adopted therein. In this paper, the analysis part of various models are discussed for 'Normal", 'Menstruation' and 'Menopause" conditions of female SMO. The total nine, best fit mathematical models (BFMM) are developed and the results are analysed, qualitatively as well as quantitatively and found ultimately complex in nature. But the degree of complexity appears least (4-juctions) in 'Normal' phase. Whereas maximum complexity (5-junctions) appears in 'Menstruation' and 'Menopause" condition. The subject shall be tested for all women factors during study but requires the substantial period which is not tolerable. Therefore SMOs of different ages are selected for covering various women factors. Since the environmental factors are uncontrollable, the effects are justified by planning the experimentation for a complete year, during different seasons. 'Normal' phase is more responsive to performance than other women phases. SIMOs require adjustable stool height convenient to their seating. The work of testing the effect of 'women factors' on the performance capability of sewing operation had been tested and evaluated for the first time and are important parameters to avoid the post ill-effect on health caused due to unhealthy situations at different stages of women workers during their lifetime

AB  - Historically, transportation planning has emphasized mobility by private vehicles. A more balanced approach, one that respects resource limits and acknowledges sustainability goals, is needed. Transportation is a means, not an end in and of itself, and must be planned accordingly. In estimating future travel demand, researchers are now using statistical models that recognize new highway improvements induce new trips. The focus is also shifting to understanding how urban activities and interpersonal relationships shape travel behavior. Planning for accessibility as a complement to mobility-based planning gives legitimacy to land-use initiatives like traditional neighborhood designs and transit-supportive developments. When concerns like livability and sustainability are weighed, transportation initiatives such as traffic-calmed streets and cooperative-based car-sharing gain wider acceptance. Evolving economic, demographic, and urbanization trends pose significant challenges to the future of transportation planning. Advanced information technologies will allow motorists to follow less congested paths. Also, they enable congestion charges to be passed on to motorists, as currently applied in Singapore. Hardware improvements, however, must be matched by supporting institutional initiatives which improve the coordination between transportation and land-use programs. Public–private partnerships, regional transportation authorities, and large-scale smart-growth are promising ways of delivering efficient and safe transportation services that promote a more livable and sustainable future.

AB  - To enhance the efficiency of intermodal transportation for large quantities of goods, the current sea-land transportation system has been reviewed and systematically analyzed, and a bottleneck is pinpointed in the linkage or goods transfer between the waterway and railway. The bottleneck impacts the efficiency of the goods through transportation combining the two modes. To eliminate the existing bottleneck and inefficiency towards intermodality, a new type of flexible double-rail track has recently been invented together with innovations both in trestle bridges and in train ferries. The outcomes of the research in progress show that the flexible double-rail track is feasible from the viewpoints of both geometry and engineering mechanics, it can be used to improve the compatibility of a trestle bridge with various types of train ferries and hence it can support the development of train ferries on a large scale. Based on the innovations, an integrated sea-land transportation system model is proposed as a systematic solution, which is expected to effectively overcome the existing bottleneck and to enhance the efficiency of the whole sea-land combined transportation. Further research on this system model and its major components is also addressed in the paper. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we investigate to find out a practical solution for transportation temporal, spatial and attribute information storage and management, to avoid data redundancy and enable effective spatio-temporal analysis. Firstly, object oriented method is used to abstract transportation information data into different kinds of spatio-temporal objects. Then time stamps are added to those objects to express their static semanteme, and by the method of direct storing events, temporal topologies are built between objects to express their dynamic semanteme. This solution can be realized based on mature RDBMS data structure, so it is relatively easy to carry out and presents well practicability

AB  - A statistical model has been developed for the prediction of changes in oxidant air quality as a function of location resulting from the creation of an indirect source or the implementation of a land use or transportation plan. The model is implemented, as an illustrative example, for the regional air basin comprised of San Diego County, in the United States, and Tijuana, in Mexico. Los Angeles and San Diego geocoded reactive hydrocarbon emission inventories from mobile and stationary sources for 1969 and 1970 have been used with wind data and observed oxidant air quality in order to calibrate a statistical relationship between emissions and air quality. This relationship, applied to the San Diego-Tijuana region, has then been used with a 1975 base case geocoded emissions inventory to generate a base case 1975 oxidant index as a function of position. An altered 1975 geocoded emissions function incorporating the predicted emissions effects of changed land use can then be employed to generate a new 1975 oxidant function. The difference between the new and old oxidant functions represents the effect, area by area, of the change in land use on air quality. To demonstrate the possibilities of this type of model, three examples of air quality impact assessments have been carried out: first, the impact of a proposed regional shopping center, second, the effects of a proposed large scale development, third, an analysis of an "Existing Trends" 1995 alternative regional transportation and land use plan for the San Diego-Tijuana region. The resulting predicted changes in oxidant air quality, measured by the number of additional hours per year that the U.S. Federal oxidant standard is to be exceeded, are displayed as a function of position over the air basin. Given the emissions resulting from changed land use, the calculation of air quality change requires only a modest amount of computer time, and thus this type of model can inexpensively and rapidly be used to evaluate the approximate air pollution effects of planning alternatives.

AB  - The subject of this paper is planning of public transportation in sparsely populated areas. The paper consists of four main parts. In part I an analysis of the system to be planned is carried out. A comparison with a survey on the traffic and transportation models available in the literature, though very voluminous, reveals a lack of a general model-framework for planning public transportation in sparsely populated areas. It is the aim of the present paper to fill this gap. Part II discusses how to evaluate optional plans for the physical and socio-economic structure of a region and concludes that this must be done by means of accessibility. Acessibility is defined in this paragraph. In part III a model is presented which describes the interdependance between on one hand the demand of accessibility of the population and on the other hand the transportation system, both public and private, and the location of facilities and residential areas. The applicability of some standard transportation and traffic models is discussed briefly in this section. Finally part IV describes a case study, in which the models set out in part III are applied. Some results are presented with conclusions.

A comparison with a survey on the traffic and transportation models available in the literature, though very voluminous, reveals a lack of a general model-framework for planning public transportation in sparsely populated areas. It is the aim of the present paper to fill this gap. Part II discusses how to evaluate optional plans for the physical and socio-economic structure of a region and concludes that this must be done by means of accessibility. Acessibility is defined in this paragraph. In part III a model is presented which describes the interdependance between on one hand the demand of accessibility of the population and on the other hand the transportation system, both public and private, and the location of facilities and residential areas. The applicability of some standard transportation and traffic models is discussed briefly in this section. Finally part IV describes a case study, in which the models set out in part III are applied. Some results are presented with conclusions.

AB  - The relationships between land use and biodiversity are fundamental to understanding the links between people and their environment. Biodiversity can be measured in many ways. The concept covers not only the overall richness of species present in a particular area but also the diversity of genotypes, functional groups, communities, habitatsandecosystems there. As a result, the relationshipsbetweenbiodiversity in its broadest senseandland use can becomplexandhighly context dependent. Moreover, the relationships between them are often two-way, so that simple relationships between cause and effect can be difficult to identify. In some places, specific land uses or land management practices may be important in sustaining particular patterns of biodiversity. Elsewhere, the uses to which land can be put are highly dependent on the biodiversity resources present. The review will consider how changes in the quantity, quality and spatial configuration of different aspects of land use can impact on different components of biodiversity, and what direct and indirect factors might drive these changes. The need to distinguish between land cover and land use will be discussed in relation to the economic and social drivers of land use change. The review will also consider whether framing biodiversity objectives involves society in placing constraints upon the types of land use andmanagementpractice that are possible,andwill considersuchargumentsin relation to assessments of the costs of biodiversity loss. It would seem that while considerable progress has been made in mapping out plausible futures for land use and biodiversity at global and regional scales, closer integration of modelling, scenario and field-based monitoring is needed to strengthen the evidence base available to decision makers. Challenges that face us include how we take account of the qualitative changes in land cover,andthe impacts of such modificationsonbiodiversityandecosystem services. Broader perspectives on the value of biodiversity and ecosystem services are also needed as the basis for developing adaptive and flexible approaches to policy and management.

AB  - This paper examines the land use policies implemented in the city of Curitiba, Brazil, from 1965 to the present. Curitiba used land use planning, the hierarchy of the road network, an economic development policy and public transport to coordinate the parameters for the location and density of homes, work, recreation, services and commerce. The city was planned as an integrated structure for living and working. Curitiba was also the fastest-growing city in Brazil during the 1970s, which demonstrates that the above approach has been successful as an effective instrument to control and direct rapid urban growth while contributing to sound environmental management. The paper describes the integration of land use/transportation policies and the instruments that contributed to its enforcement and attempts to draw selected lessons from the experience.

AB  - Urban sustainable mobility solutions are being discussed throughout the world to deal with problems of high use of land, congestion situations, energy consumption and emissions derived from road transportation. Part of these solutions concerns the promotion of public transportation as an alternative to individual transportation. Public transport only becomes an attractive option if, for the mobility provided (passenger x km), emits less pollutants and consume less energy. This paper focuses on comparing the fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions (CO2, HC, CO, NOx, PM) between urban Diesel buses (10 litres and 2.7 litres turbocharged Diesel) and typical gasoline and diesel European light duty vehicles (1.2 litres gasoline, 1.9 litres turbocharged Diesel). Results are analyzed as a function of transported passengers. For the proposed analysis, typical low traffic and congested traffic driving cycles were selected as an input to the EcoGest model, combined with driver behaviour characteristics and vehicle characteristics. Main results are easy-to-use charts highlighting where each mode is more attractive as a function of the number of passengers inside the bus and the number of people inside the vehicle. Results were obtained using EcoGest, a numerical model developed in our research institute. This model allows simulating the energetical and environmental performance of a road vehicle in a predefined route, accounting for the driving behaviour, vehicle specifications, powertrain specifications, occupation rate and road grade. The model has been used to simulate light duty and heavy duty vehicles, including gasoline, natural gas and hydrogen cars, and diesel and natural gas buses. Predicted results have been compared with measured fuel consumption and tail-pipe emissions in real-traffic situations, standard cycles (FTP75, NEDC), and predicted results of similar models (e.g. ADVISOR). Predictions of EcoGest are, usually, very good. Copyright ASCE 2008.

AB  - Although performance measures encourage agreement in other disciplines, measures for state transportation and land use may engender disagreement among stakeholders. A literature review and a survey of 25 states and three metropolitan planning organizations identified 41 such measures.  No single measure best quantifies  effective coordination because this coordination supports potentially conflicting goals, such as better access management and\nincreased local autonomy.  Further, when measures are computed under four benevolent scenarios that each generate the support of some stakeholders (reduced transit costs, reduced congestion, increased local autonomy, and increased compact development) some performance  measures indicate improvement and others do not.

AB  - A land use and transportation interaction model was developed for the Sacramento, California, region, using the MEPLAN framework. The model represents land markets directly together with location-choice processes of different industry and household categories and the interactions among them. These resulting economic interactions lead to trip matrixes that are assigned to a multimodal, capacity-restrained transportation network, generating travel times and disutilities that influence the location-choice process in the period from 1990 to 2015. A range of different policy options is simulated for that period. Five different scenarios are compared with a trend scenario, three representing different long- and short-term government transportation supply scenarios, one representing incentives and disincentives to encourage land use patterns complementary to an improved transit system, and one combining the land-incentive scenario with higher prices for private vehicle use. The scenario predictions differ in mode choice, firm location, residential location, development patterns, vehicle kilometers traveled, and land rents. Various land uses are seen to be bidding against each other, and the differences in spatial arrangements between scenarios are quite complex and demonstrate the richness of the model. Certain changes take time to develop, demonstrating the need for a long-term approach to planning.

AB  - Decision makers in freight transportation need to assess new distribution systems and the impacts of changes in the freight distribution environment on infrastructure needs and usage, logistical performance, emissions, and energy use. There is a need, therefore, for behavioral models that can predict goods flows and vehicle flows in both current and future situations. This research outlines a conceptual framework consisting of the markets, actors, and supply chain elements of freight movement. Supply chains are constructed by linking distribution channels (of different logistics characteristics) between different activity types, such as consumers, supermarkets, stores, offices, distribution centers, and factories. The framework outlined in this research was used to develop the GoodTrip model-a demand-driven, commodity-based freight movement model that incorporates supply chains. Starting with consumer demand, the model estimates goods flows and simulates vehicle tours. The open architecture of the model allows mixed use of empirical data, behavioral models, and scenario-type assumptions. The behavioral models will be developed in future research. In its first application, the GoodTrip model was used to compare the logistical performance and external impacts of three types of urban distribution systems: the traditional system and two concepts using urban distribution centers (one using vans, the other using automated underground vehicles). The results show considerable differences in the performance and effects of the alternatives, especially when they are applied to different types of distribution channels, such as food retail stores or bookstores.

AB  - Land use and transportation are linked by complex, yet identifiable, relationships. Tools are needed to formalize this relationship and to take it into account when decisions are made about urban and suburban transportation systems. This paper reviews foundational concepts of performance measures of metropolitan transportation systems. It offers a rationale for the types of tools needed to measure and assess land use and transportation system efficiency. One tool being developed by the Washington State Department of Transportation-the Transportation-Efficient Land Use Mapping Index (TELUMI)-illustrates how research findings can be applied in metropolitan transportation planning. TELUMI uses cartographic modeling (CM) techniques and parcel-level geographic information system data. The fine resolution of the data measures microscaled land use conditions associated with travel patterns in built-up areas. CM generates maps of zones in a region that match land use conditions with travel behaviors. Zones are defined by land use variables, such as density of activities, presence and agglomeration of destinations, block size, and transportation infrastructure attributes. CM also performs advanced quantitative analyses of map attributes, and it is effective with lay and professional audiences. TELUMI's use of individual land use variables makes it possible to target intervention strategies, such as augmenting density or building sidewalks, and to evaluate their effectiveness in improving transportation efficiency. TELUMI assists transportation and local planning authorities in allocating transportation investments appropriate to multimodal travel.

AB  - This paper presents the development of a strategic transportation model for marine oil transportation in US waters. The model is a high-level strategic decision-making tool that will be used to interface with a risk analysis model, to identify “weak” links in the system and evaluate alternative routing and shipping scenarios. It may also be used to provide suggestions for the designation of lightering zones which will enable the U.S. to draw from the general world supply of tanker capacity and reduce oil transportation costs and risks. The model has been developed at the request of the United States Interagency Coordinating Committee for Oil Pollution Research to allow for the quantification of oil transported within the geographic boundaries of the United States, for the analysis of risks and effects of oil spills, and finally the identification of appropriate technologies that will support intervention and mitigation to reduce the impact of spills.

AB  - A transportation planning model that integrates regional and local-area forecasting approaches is developed and applied. Although regional models have the scope to model the interaction of demand and conges- tion, they lack spatial detail. Local-area analysis typically does not con- sider the feedback between new project loadings and existing levels of traffic. A windowed model, which retains regional trip distribution information and the consistency between travel demand and congestion, permits the use of a complete transportation network and block-level traffic zones while retaining computational feasibility. By combining the two methods a number of important policy issues can be addressed, including the implications of traffic calming, changes in flow due to alternative traffic operation schemes, the influence of microscale zon- ing changes on nearby intersections, and the impact of travel demand management on traffic congestion.

That remains the most sustainable pattern. After World War II, the automobile promoted a pattern of scattered activities and spread out residences. Most other countries resisted the spread and scattered pattern, though without complete success; the US has only begun to recentralize.

AB  - In the past 10 years, integrated land use and transportation modeling has received considerable attention in the scholarly literature. This academic interest is slowly yielding practical applications. In the USA, many metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) and state departments of transportation are beginning to implement these types of model for the first time. While many improvements have been made to these models, and the value of these improvements should not be understated, much work still remains. One of the most challenging problems in land use modeling is how floorspace (buildings) is built and occupied. The purpose of this article is twofold: first, to draw attention to insufficiencies in the representation of floorspace developer behavior-particularly as it applies to large, urban-edge projects - within current integrated land use and transportation models and, second, to determine the necessity of explicitly accounting for such projects within these models. The Sacramento MEPLAN model will be used together with historical development records to demonstrate and test these assertions. Single large developments are modeled with a common year of development, size, and location. Among the findings, large developments are fairly common in the Sacramento region and make up a considerable amount of floorspace development in absolute terms, large basic sector developments have more of an impact and are therefore more important to explicitly account for than are large non-basic sector developments. A single large basic sector development modeled in a 20-year forecast has a significant impact on zonal outputs. Recommendations are put forward regarding the use of this research in practical modeling exercises. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

Among the findings, large developments are fairly common in the Sacramento region and make up a considerable amount of floorspace development in absolute terms, large basic sector developments have more of an impact and are therefore more important to explicitly account for than are large non-basic sector developments. A single large basic sector development modeled in a 20-year forecast has a significant impact on zonal outputs. Recommendations are put forward regarding the use of this research in practical modeling exercises. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Drawing on recent work in environmental economics, this paper introduces the concept of the land use intensity of economic activity, analogous to the more familiar materials and energy intensities. It then considers how this might be measured, looking at a range of economic and land use change statistics, and how it might be reduced. Environmental compensation is seen as a possible means of achieving the latter objective. It is argued that no single measure of land use Intensity would be meaningful, because concern about [`]lost land' Is typically not about land in terms of hectares or economic value, but about the environmental significance of land use change. This in turn reflects a variety of material, post-material and non-instrumental values. The paper concludes that composite measures of the land use intensity of economic activity are likely to be the most useful; that environmental compensation may be a useful policy instrument within a carefully formulated framework; and that differences in values have to be confronted if sustainable land use change is ever to be defined.

AB  - The relationship between urban form, as shaped through transit-oriented urban design, and transportation demand, as represented by regional travel demand forecasting model techniques, is investigated. The research from two studies is synthesized and, through development of travel demand forecasting model enhancements in the form of a subarea model and off-line estimation techniques, a link is sought between data analysis at the regional scale and urban design and land use strategies applied at the local and subregional scales. A methodology for aggregating individual transit-oriented development sites into a subregional growth scenario is described. Findings are reported from use of the subarea model to compare impacts of a transit-oriented growth scenario with a conventional growth scenario for a subregion of suburban communities.

AB  - A comprehensive study of static transportation network optimization\nproblems with stochastic user equilibrium constraints is presented. It\nis explicitly demonstrated that the formulation of the fixed-point\nproblem - in terms of link flows for the general stochastic user\nequilibrium problem in which the Jacobian matrix of link travel cost\nfunctions may not be symmetric-possesses a unique solution with mild\nconditions. By developing a sensitivity analysis method for the\nstochastic user equilibrium problem, the study proves that the perturbed\nequilibrium link flows are continuously differentiable implicit\nfunctions with respect to perturbation parameters. Accordingly, it can\nbe concluded that the proposed unified bilevel programming model, which\ncan characterize transportation network optimization problems subject to\nstochastic user equilibrium constraints, is a smooth optimization\nproblem. In addition, the study presents a single-level continuously\ndifferentiable optimization formulation that is equivalent to the\nunified bilevel programming model. Furthermore, as a unified solution\nmethod, a successive quadratic programming algorithm based on the\nsensitivity analysis method is used to solve the transportation network\noptimization problems with stochastic user equilibrium constraints.\nFinally, two examples are used to demonstrate the proposed models and\nalgorithm.

AB  - In current practice, very few Metropolitan Planning Agencies attempt to capture the effects of transportation system changes on land use, and the consequent feedback effects on transportation system performance, despite substantial evidence that these effects may be significant. In this paper, we present a case study on the application of UrbanSim, a detailed land use simulation model system, and its integration with a regional travel demand model in the Greater Wasatch area of Utah. Like several other metropolitan areas, this region has recently been confronted with legal challenges to proposed highway projects, drawing substantial scrutiny to the land use-transportation connection. We describe the UrbanSim model specification, results from model estimation, and sensitivity analyses conducted with the combined land use and travel model system. The results of the sensitivity analysis suggest that accounting for the land use effects of a regional transportation plan may produce significant shifts in key transportation evaluation measures such as vehicle miles traveled, vehicle hours traveled, and hours of congestion delay.

It shows that the popular image of cities spreading across the countryside is a false one. In fact most new housing is built within existing settlements or in small rural developments, whilst more crop and grazing land has been turned over to woodland in the past 25 years than into housing. It also shows that market forces, taxes and subsidies have a rapid effect on land use decisions by developers, farmers and others, for example on what type of housing to build, what crops to grow and whether to turn farmland into woodland. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - Land use/cover change (LUCC) is one of the most concerned environmental problems by scientists, land managers and policy makers. LUCC can affect energy flow, biogeochemical and hydrological cycling in terrestrial ecosystems through altering land surface and species composition. Ecosystem carbon cycling responds differently to various LUCC types, showing a pattern of CO2 release into the atmosphere when LUCC from a high-biomass forest to low-biomass grassland, cropland or urban area. Previous reports indicated that global terrestrial ecosystem released 2.21 Pg C (1 Pg C=1015 g C) per year induced by LUCC during the 1990s, which explains about 25% of the global C emission per year in the same period; and in the last two centuries, the released C from LUCC accounts for 50% of the C emission from fossil fuel combustion. The LUCC patterns are totally diversified for regions around the world, which cause obviously different C fluxes among them. The reports showed that LUCC in the tropics is a C source, while it is a C sink in the middle and high latitude regions in the northern hemisphere, which possibly explain a large part of the "missing carbon sink" in the terrestrial ecosystems. Currently, modelling is the most popular way to simulate LUCC-induced changes in ecosystem C cycling. The quantitative relationship between LUCC patterns and their related processes and ecosystem carbon cycling remains uncertain. This uncertainty causes great discrepancies in the estimation of terrestrial ecosystem CO2 fluxes from land use/cover changes. In the near future, except for carrying on long-term experiments to determine these quantitative relationships, model development by integrating LUCC with vegetation dynamic model and ecosystem process model will be essential for making an accurate estimation of C fluxes induced by LUCC. Sound land management can greatly increase C storage in the terrestrial ecosystems during LUCC processes. However, the quantification of land management effects is not well-established yet and land management is thus not included in most simulation models of LUCC impacts, which needs more researches in the future.

AB  - This paper describes a series of tests carried out with a comprehensive transportation, land use and air quality simulation system, which has been designed for planning application at the metropolitan or regional scale, within the framework of the U.S. Government's Clean Air legislation. The urban location portion of the system was developed at the University of Pennsylvania under the direction of S. H. Putman. The air quality sections incorporate models formulated in earlier studies. The system was tested with data from the San Francisco Bay area, for the period 1975–1980. The test policies included changes in regional transportation costs and population totals; local interventions in the transportation network; and controls on pollutant emissions from mobile and stationary sources. To assess net impacts, the outcomes predicted for each policy were compared with the outcomes predicted in a “benchmark”, or base run of the system. The tests showed that the system is sensitive to a broad range of air quality policies, and that it is capable of predicting important air quality consequences of transportation and land use policies. Some further development will be needed before the system can be used in practical planning situations, but there is little doubt as to the soundness of its central theoretical constructs and logical structure.

AB  - On September 30, 1991, the University of Washington, in cooperation with the Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle, implemented U-PASS, one of the most comprehensive transportation demand management programs in the United States. The U-PASS program was developed in response to campus and community concerns for trip reduction and improved commuter services in view of possible impacts from planned campus development. The U-PASS program is a flexible package of transportation benefits offered through a pass that allows University of Washington students, faculty, and staff to choose from a variety of commuting options at a greatly reduced price. U-PASS is a $17.4 million 3-year demonstration program that began in October 1991. Parking system revenue funds cover 30% of the program. To achieve this funding level, parking fees were raised to the market rate of the University District. At a 75% participation rate, monthly U-PASS user fees of $9.00 for faculty and staff and $6.67 for students contribute 40% of the cost. The remaining 30% of the program is subsidized by the university through a variety of funding sources. After 1 year of operation, the U-PASS program has been viewed as a success and a model to other employers. Vehicle trips to campus are down 16%, parking lot use has decreased from 91% to 78%, transit ridership is up 35%, carpools have increased 21% and the number of vanpools grew from 8 to 20 in less than 9 months.

AB  - This themed issue of Land Use Policy builds mainly on papers presented at an international conference on 'Land Use Issues and Policy in China under Rapid Rural and Urban Transformation', convened by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China, in October 2012. The conference set out to share and promote new scientific findings from a range of disciplines that advance research on land use policy in China. The contributions to this themed issue provide conceptual-theoretical and empirical takes on the topic, around four main areas of interest to both researchers and policymakers: nation-wide land use issues, the Sloping Land Conversion Program, land engineering and land use, and land use transitions. Various land use issues have been associated with rapid urban-rural transformations in China, giving rise to formulation of new policies directly affecting land use. However, these have contributed to new land use problems due to the nature of the policies and the difficulties in policy implementation constrained by the special 'dual-track' structure of urban-rural development in China. In view of this, this themed edition makes a compelling call for more systematic research into the making and implementation of China's land use policy. It also emphasizes the challenges for further research on land use policy in China. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To overcome these limitations, parcel-level data and geographic information system software were used to identify and measure attributes of land use. These data are at a level of resolution that closely corresponds to the spatial distribution of development patterns. A method for location of concentrations of medium- to high-density housing and commercial development in suburban areas identified in previous research is described. The method includes the use of metrics derived from landscape ecology to model these development patterns and, specifically, their shapes and their functional and spatial mixes.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic framework toward the development of a Transportation Model for Hazardous Materials (HazMat). In practice, the proposed modeling framework is realized through an appropriate generalization of the traditional transportation network problem in the presence of safety constraints that need to be satisfied. The objective is to minimize transportation cost while reducing risks at the desired levels.In particular, the present research study identifies and evaluates different risk factors that influence the HazMat transportation network. Next, the transportation model is depicted graphically using nodes and arcs and optimal conditions are identified by solving the associated minimum cost flow network problem. The results show safety levels that help making informed decisions on choosing the optimal transportation configuration for hazardous material shipments.Within the proposed methodological context, appropriately parameterized simulation studies elucidate the effects of occurrence probabilities of the different risk events on transportation cost. Furthermore, as the appropriate management decisions must consider the effect of actions in one time period on future periods, the proposed model is structured as a multi-periodic model.Finally, the proposed methodological approach is employed to demonstrate the utility of proper analytical tools in decision making and particularly in ensuring that scientifically informed safety procedures are in place while transporting goods that can be potentially proven dangerous to the public and the surroundings. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The model has the following distinctive characteristics: (1) a detailed representation of different freight rail yard operations is made and railway services with their operational characteristics are considered explicitly; (2) priorities are assigned to different types of freight cars to be moved, depending on the products transported; (3) the distribution of empty freight cars and their assignment over the rail network is treated simultaneously with the assignment of products to be transported; and (4) capacity constraints are considered for the movement of various products. Solution approaches are discussed. The model can be used to evaluate freight railway systems, including yard operations and rail services management policies.

AB  - The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) updates its long-range transportation plan every 5 years. The plan sets forth strategies, provides a framework for directing investment, and identifies financial resources needed to sustain the plan's vision. Setting the direction of a long-range transportation program revolves around forecasting future transportation conditions and managing investments to address future needs. An analysis tool was needed to help assess the impact of growth on the statewide transportation system and predict system performance based on multimodal strategic investments. The development and use of an analysis tool based on a travel demand model to assess congestion and mobility issues in 2025 are described. The analysis tool linked the state's three metropolitan planning organization (MPO) regional travel demand models to perform a statewide assessment. Although the models were run independently, methods were developed to provide a common basis for forecasting future travel conditions. The models used MPO-generated trend-based growth in population and employment through 2025. Multi-modal transportation supply and demand strategies, including transit improvements, capacity improvements, transportation demand management strategies, and intelligent transportation systems-transportation system management strategies, were simulated and tested to assess what types and combinations of improvements would be needed to relieve congestion and improve mobility. The tool proved very helpful in defining transportation needs and providing input to a financial assessment. The testing indicated that no single strategy is likely to improve future travel conditions, but a combination of multimodal strategies offers significant improvements over congestion levels predicted for 2025 if no improvements are made.

AB  - A theoretical planning model that consists of a composite set of modal networks for serving the population in an urban area or region is presented. By varying and controling various parameters in the model, an equilibrium of modal choices can be obtained by seeking the condition that no user can alter his path without experiencing an increase in cost. The equivalence between equilibrium conditions and a nonlinear programming problem will be established, following a fundamental theorem. Thus, under small perturbations in the composite network, either through changes in the frequency of certain trips or changes in the structure of the network, it is possible to linearize about the observed equilibrium to determine the effects of perturbations.

AB  - The growing demand for better coordination of metropolitan land use and transportation planning has led to the need for new analytical tools to examine the potential impacts of land-use and transportation policies and investments. In this paper I report on the residential and market-clearing components of the recently developed UrbanSim land-use model, which is currently being implemented in Hawaii, Oregon, and Utah. The model is based on parcel-level land-use data and simulates the interaction between demand and supply of real estate by using a dynamic behavioral approach that operates on an annual time schedule. The model system is now operational, and in this paper the design and calibration results for the Eugene-Springfield, Oregon metropolitan area are described.

AB  - Land use and transportation models are typically given precise inputs and return precise outputs. This precision should not be mistaken for accuracy. The purpose of this paper is to introduce uncertainty into three inputs and one parameter of a fully integrated land use and travel demand model - MEPLAN - to determine the effect of uncertain inputs on model outputs. Inputs were selected based upon there being expected sources of uncertainty. Inputs were varied individually based upon plausible amounts of error and the marginal impact of each on outputs was examined. Counter to the findings of previous similar studies, uncertainty in the socio-economic forecasts did not dominate the final amounts of error observed in the model outputs. The propagation of error across model years, as well as the final level of error in the end-year, is examined. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Development has ended isolation in many parts of Kalimantan, Indonesia, and provides previously isolated communities with the opportunity for greater involvement in a market economy. This paper describes the use of a simulation model to study the possible impacts of greater involvement in cash cropping in swidden agricultural systems. The model uses both individual-based and rule-based modelling approaches. The model formulation is based on a previous report of the social structure, culture and agricultural production system of the Kantu' in West Kalimantan [Dove, M.R., 1985. Swidden Agriculture in Indonesia: The Subsistence Strategies of the Kalimantan Kantu'. Mouton Publishers, Berlin]. The model simulates: (1) births, deaths, marriage, household formation and dissolution; (2) land use decisions on the type, number and location of swidden cultivation; and (3) tracks the consequences of those decisions at a landscape level as well as the economic welfare of the households. The model deals with swidden cultivation of rice and the planting and tapping of rubber. The paper presents a simulation 'experiment' that compares different land use strategies under a scenario of fluctuating rubber price. An important finding is that maintaining swidden cultivation as 'an option' in the farming system, rather than permanently replacing swidden cultivation with cash cropping, appears to be a safer strategy to moderate the impact of commodity price fluctuations

AB  - The urgency of the environmental debate has renewed the interest in the application of integrated models of urban land use and transportation. In the United States new legislation inspired by growing environmental awareness such as the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 requires that transportation planning must consider the interaction between transportation and land use in a consistent fashion – as it can be done only by land-use transportation models. However, this new interest in land use models also presents new challenges to the land use modelling community. A new generation of activity-based travel models and new neighborhoodscale transportation planning policies require more detailed information on household demographics and employment characteristics and the location of activities. Moreover, the models need to be able to predict not only economic but also environmental impacts of land-use transportation policies. Today there exist several operational urban land-use transportation models which have the potential to respond to these challenges. At the same time there exist exciting opportunities to incorporate new theoretical developments and methodologies into the field. The paper reviews the current state of the art of operational land-use transportation models using criteria such as comprehensiveness, overall structure, theoretical foundations, modeling techniques, dynamics, data requirements, calibration and validation, operationality and applicability and evaluates their suitability with respect to the new requirements and speculates about the most promising avenues to further improvement and diffusion of this kind of model.

AB  - This study is a contribution to an exercise to construct land use change scenarios for Europe as part of the European Commission funded ATEAM (Advanced Terrestrial Ecosystem Analysis and Modelling) project. The purpose of the study is to examine recent trends in land use change as they relate to forests in the pre-enlargement European Union member countries, Switzerland and Norway, and to construct narratives and preliminary quantitative estimates of future trends in forest land use that are consistent with the four storylines presented by the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). These storylines describe different types of future worlds during the 21st century defined according to societal values (ranging between consumerist/individualist and community-minded values) and according to scales of governance (between globalised and localised). Several quantitative scenarios are associated with each storyline. The analysis indicates a continuous growth of forest area in most parts of Europe in recent years, with an average annual increase of about 0.3 percent. For the future, the study estimates decreasing forest area in the consumer-orientated worlds and slightly accelerated area growth rates in the community-orientated worlds. The scenarios are at a national scale, and could not be used directly as projections on the regular geographical grid employed in ATEAM. Rather, they were intended to serve as reliability or consistency checks for more comprehensive scenarios incorporating urban and agricultural land uses, protected areas and biofuels, constructed within the project. A firm conclusion of the study is that national forest policies currently play a central role in determining future land use in Europe. Future work on scenario development will require a comprehensive framework that integrates policies as key driving forces of land use change.

AB  - Urban containment strategies are one of the best-known planning instruments for managing urban sprawl. The two main types of such strategies are greenbelts and urban growth boundaries. The boundaries set by the Land Use Plan in Switzerland have been applied since 1970. We evaluate the effect and success of this strategy by analysing expansion of developed land, change in number of buildings, and building density within and outside building zones in four Swiss municipalities 1970-2000. Our results show that the boundary restricted most development to building zones and promoted increased building density. Generally, building density increased in the building zones but decreased outside of building zones. For more efficiency and success, the political institutions should specify explicit goals for development inside and outside of building zones, and develop new instruments for guiding development outside of building zones. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - RELU is a dynamic general equilibrium model of a metropolitan economy and its land use, derived by unifying in a theoretically valid way, models developed by one of the authors [Anas (1982), Anas-Arnott (1991, 1997), Anas-Kim (1996), Anas-Xu (1999)]. RELU equilibrates floor space, land and labor markets, and the market for the products of industries, treating development (construction and demolition), spatial interindustry linkages, commuting, and discretionary travel. Mode choices and equilibrium congestion on the highway network are treated by unifying RELU with the TRAN algorithm of stochastic user equilibrium [Anas-Kim (1990)]. The RELU-TRAN algorithm's performance for a stationary state is demonstrated for a prototype consisting of 4-building, 4-industry, 4-labor-type, 15-land-use-zone, 68-link-highway-network version of the Chicago MSA. The algorithm solves 656 equations in a special block-recursive convergent procedure by iterations nested within loops and loops within cycles. Runs show excellent and smooth convergence from different starting points, so that the number of loops within successive cycles continually decreases. The tests also imply a numerically ascertained unique stationary equilibrium solution of the unified model for the calibrated parameters. ¬© Blackwell Publishing, Inc. 2007.

AB  - One of the major tasks in transition to a hydrogen economy is to build a cost-effective infrastructure of hydrogen supply. Building an infrastructure of hydrogen supply includes a series of logistical steps from production through delivery and storage to utilization of the hydrogen. This paper attempts to build the cost-effective central hydrogen supply system using a transportation model. As a case study, a hydrogen delivery plan for 2040 was established by dividing the Korean peninsula into two regions, northern and southern regions. Average hydrogen delivery distances for 2040 in the northern and the southern regions are estimated as 69.8 km and 85.2 km. The subsequently derived hydrogen supply network of centrally produced hydrogen in 2040 is expected to be similar to the liquefied natural gas pipeline network in 2005. The derived hydrogen supply network, delivery distances, and delivery costs are expected to provide a set of basic and indispensable information in building a cost-effective infrastructure of hydrogen supply in the Korean peninsula. ?? 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - In densely populated areas, space for development is confined, making spatial planning essential to reconcile the interests of all stakeholders. In the process of policymaking, possible future land-use scenarios are often very valuable as a reference point, but the optimal configuration in terms of costs and effects might provide even more valuable inputs when decisions have to be taken. Tools for exploring optimal land-use configurations are therefore of great interest to policymakers. With these tools, plans can be evaluated and adjusted. Spatial optimisation is a powerful method to explore the potentials of a given area to improve the spatial coherence of land-use functions. In the Netherlands, there are many different planning issues in which multi-objective spatial optimisation can play an important role. This chapter describes two case studies that apply the genetic algorithm approach.

AB  - The management of land-use change has been achieved in Britain through the development control system. Set up in its modern form in 1947, the system has remained substantially unchanged in spite of a radically altered policy environment. This paper considers the nature of the system and notes both its robustness and its flexibility as well as the accusations of delay and uncertainty that are levelled at it. It considers the drivers for change which are likely to affect the system, and in particular the challenge of climate change, the rights of third parties, the question of major infrastructure projects, and the desire for neighbourhood protection. The paper concludes by asserting that there is a need to refocus the debate on the quality of outcomes rather than on the process. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - A zero - one integer-programming formulation of the simultaneous optimization of the problems of land-use assignment and transportation-network design is presented. The problem is modeled through a set-partitioning approach and incorporates a multiple-criteria objective function, appropriate upper- and lower-bound constraints on area assignments, and construction costs. A simple example and a more complicated urban-design case study are included to demonstrate the viability of this approach in solving the simultaneous-optimization problem. As a secondary benefit, this set-partitioning model can be reformulated as an integer, generalized-network, flow problem for which new efficient computer codes, capable of solving networks with thousands of nodes and variables, are available.

AB  - Rather than a bad case of urban sprawl, the physical expansion of China's megacities may be viewed as a combination of 'urban spill over' and 'local urban sprawl'. This paper reviews land use regulations in their institutional context and argues that conflicts in land use regulation are related to ideologies of land ownership and embedded in different planning doctrines. These hypotheses are investigated with special reference to Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province in southern China. The evidence suggests that entangled land use regulations for "urban" and "rural" land have imposed serious constraints on urban growth, while the contradictions of different policies and regulations in the use of rural lands for urban construction have led to intensive and unhealthy competition among stakeholders. As a result, not only have the costs of land conversion from rural to urban uses increased, but the spatial development of Guangzhou has been distorted. The implications of these failures for future policy are discussed with emphasis on the reform of the land use regulation system. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Integrated transportation planning is an emerging transportation planning concept that is intended to help seek those policies, programs, and projects that meet a given set of transportation goals and objectives for the minimum total social cost. Its elements include analysis of a full range of alternatives, the use of benefit-cost analysis to compare alternatives, public involvement in the development and evaluation of alternatives, analysis of uncertainties in forecasts of future conditions, and continuous monitoring of transportation system performance. The theory and methods of integrated transportation planning for implementation by a metropolitan planning organization developed for the Puget Sound Regional Council are discussed. The discussion includes how integrated transportation planning fits into the strategic planning process, the similarities and differences between integrated transportation planning and the current transportation planning process, and the analytic issues raised by implementing integrated transportation planning.

AB  - The dynamic traffic control problem and the dynamic traffic assignment problem are integrated as a noncooperative game between a traffic authority and highway users. The objective of the combined control-assignment problem is to find a mutually consistent dynamic system-optimal signal setting and dynamic user-optimal traffic flow. The combined control-assignment problem is first formulated as a one-level Cournot game: the traffic authority and the users choose their strategies simultaneously. The combined control-assignment problem is subsequently formulated as a bi-level Stackelberg game. The traffic authority is the leader; it determines the signal settings in anticipation of the users' reactions. The users are followers who choose their routes after the signal settings have been determined. Finally, the system-optimal control-assignment problem is formulated as a Monopoly game. The sole player-the traffic authority-determines both signal settings and traffic flows to achieve a dynamic system-optimal solution. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the equilibria of the games.

AB  - The process of planning and constructing a new light rail system or freeway, setting an urban growth boundary, changing tax policy, or modifying zoning and land use plans is often politically charged. Our goal in the UrbanSim project is to provide tools for stakeholders to be able to consider different scenarios, and then to evaluate these scenarios by modeling the resulting patterns of urban growth and redevelopment, of transportation usage, and of environmental impacts, over periods of 20-30 years. UrbanSim, combined with transportation models and macroeconomic inputs, performs simulations of the interactions among urban development, transportation, land use, and environmental impacts. It consists of a set of interacting component models that simulate different actors or processes within the urban environment.

AB  - This paper reports on the design, specification and empirical results of a discrete choice real estate development model and a hedonic regression land price model for the Greater Wasatch Front Area of Utah, using 150 by 150 meter grid cells as the units of analysis. The real estate development and land price models are components of the UrbanSim model system, in which, they interact with demand model components for residential location and employment location. Parcel data were geo-coded to grid cells, classified into composite development types, and the year of construction used to generate a chronology of development within each cell. The real estate development model simulates the annual probability that a cell will remain in its current state or experience a development event that involves the addition of housing or nonresidential floor-space, and a potential transition to one of 24 development types. The land price model simulates the land price for each cell, given its locational characteristics and accessibility. Spatial measures describing the real estate and land use composition of the neighborhood, recent development patterns, distance from existing development, site characteristics such as proximity to highways and arterials, and regional access measures incorporating the composite utility of travel to population, are used as independent variables. Estimation results indicate the importance of both localized and regional accessibility on real estate development and prices, and reflect the effects of comprehensive land use plan constraints on development outcomes and prices.

AB  - Landscape patterns and processes reflect both natural ecosystem attributes and the policy and management decisions of individual Federal, State, county, and private organizations. Land-use regulation, water management, and habitat conservation and restoration efforts increasingly rely on landscape-level approaches that incorporate scientific information into the decisionmaking process. Since management actions are implemented to affect future conditions, decision-support models are necessary to forecast potential future conditions resulting from these decisions. Spatially explicit modeling approaches enable testing of different scenarios and help evaluate potential outcomes of management actions in conjunction with natural processes such as climate change. The ability to forecast the effects of changing land use and climate is critically important to land and resource managers since their work is inherently site specific, yet conservation strategies and practices are expressed at higher spatial and temporal scales that must be considered in the decisionmaking process.
