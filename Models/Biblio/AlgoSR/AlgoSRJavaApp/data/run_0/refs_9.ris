AB  - The previous method of integration [Kovač Kralj, A., Glavič, P., & Krajnc, M. (2002). Waste heat integration between processes. Applied Thermal Engineering, 22, 1259-1269] was extended to heat integration between processes using three possible steps:internal integration of individual processes;analysis of possible heat transfer between internally nonintegrated and integrated processes;simultaneous external heat integration between the internally nonintegrated and the best internally integrated processes using the mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). The method is based on energy saving. Simultaneous integration between processes can be performed using MINLP algorithm (step 3), in which alternatives suggested by pinch analysis of the heat transfer between several internally nonintegrated and integrated processes can be included (step 2). The fraction of the maximum integration between processes can be calculated. The integration between the processes can be carried out using all the three steps, or by the first and the third step or by the last step only, depending on the complexity of the problems. The method is very general, it can be used in new designs and in existing processes integration. The approach has been illustrated by integrating four existing complex processes using pinch analysis and MINLP. The objective was to maximize the annual profit of integration between processes and retrofits. The simultaneous MINLP integration of the four processes has selected only two retrofitted ones yielding total additional profit of 1.94 MUSD/a. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper examines the genesis, policy attributes and applications of Javier Pulgar Vidal's pioneering geographic framework of national land use in Peru. It represents the early design of a state-indigenous perspective on land use and policy incorporating geovisualization techniques. Propelled initially through populist agrarian and indigenista politics, it presages general elements of the current prospect of national land use policies under multicultural environmental governance being expanded in many countries. Ongoing application of Pulgar Vidal's geographic framework is concentrated on three themes: (i) indigenous agroecological zonation and regional development; (ii) food security utilizing indigenous agrobiodiversity; and (iii) geo-spatial ordering of cultural-environmental informatics. Important influence and widespread application of this framework, as well as major limitations, have stemmed from its hybrid character. As an intermediate-level conceptual framework it provides a versatile capacity for organizing wide-ranging information on complex land use, linking actors and institutions in diverse land use initiatives, and as an advanced perspective on cultural-environmental adaptations involving major indigenous influences. Its contribution is less significant as a predictive theory and it largely fails to generate participatory inputs or politically empowering processes of direct benefit to indigenous people and organizations. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The success of Singapore's public housing land use policy has been well documented, but little is known of Singapore's land use policy regarding private housing. In the 1970s government concern over urban sprawl and the shortage of private housing led to the adoption of the condominium concept as a planning device for private housing development. This article assesses the extent to which the objectives of this policy have been fulfilled by an analysis of the development of condominiums and their effect on the property market.

This expansion has placed great stress on for- est, land and water ecosystems. Much of the city’s rapid growth in population has been accommodated in informal settlements on steep slopes and flood plains, with little attempt being made to limit the risk of landslides, rapid erosion and flash floods. The paper ends with recommendations for protecting the remaining forest, for managing water resources and drainage systems and for ensuring that housing and other urban needs are met with- out jeopardizing the supporting ecosystems.

AB  - Farming has been the basis to work, culture and social forces for millennia. It still dominates the lives of most of the world's poorer people, but in post-industrial western countries agriculture's contribution to national economies is now minor. Nevertheless, most OECD countries' agricultural policies are aimed at maintaining the size of this sector even where this conflicts with its economic significance or adversely affects the environment. Australia has a first world economy, but a third world export profile, with 20% of its export value derived from agriculture. Although it is efficient in agricultural man-power, this sector consumes 70% of the water and 60% of the land resources of the continent to produce food for an estimated 55 million people. Agricultural policies maintain the productivity of the sector, but are ineffective in stemming the associated environmental degradation, biodiversity loss and rural population decline. As in other post-industrial societies, Australia needs to re-define what its agriculture sector represents, environmentally and socially. This will require greater reappraisal of property rights, public and private benefits and legal structures supporting both. More effective alternative policies are needed for large tracts of unproductive farmland where environmental and social decline are endemic. This paper explores alternative options that offer more balanced prospects in the face of current paradoxes, including paying farmers directly for stewardship services, providing better incentives for retiring non-productive areas from agricultural land use, and retiring watersheds, streamlines and other areas of essential environmental function from agricultural production for better biodiversity conservation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Due to additional trip production by land use development, the O-D travel costs between some O-D pairs may also change intuitively. This leads to positive and negative impacts on network users traveling between different O-D pairs. Therefore the equity issue about the benefit distribution gained from the land-use development problem is raised. This paper proposes an Equity based Land-Use Transportation Problem (ELUTP) which is intended to examine the benefit distribution among the network users and the resulting equity associated with land-use development problem in terms of the change of equilibrium O-D travel cost. In the resulting bi-level programming model, the upper level sub-problem maximizes traffic production incorporating equity constraints, while the lower level sub-problem is a combined trip distribution/assignment user equilibrium problem. Genetic algorithm based method is applied to test the models using an example network.

AB  - Carleton University’s experimental atrium and tunnel facilities share a fan chamber and three large exhaust fans. Using oxygen consumption calorimetry, the Heat Release Rates (HRR) of fires in either of these facilities can be calculated. This paper focuses on the design of the instrumentation in the fan chamber, which was carried out using the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and manual velocity measurements. Due to a high amount of mixing and turbulence and a long travel distance, the temperature and gas concentration profiles are relatively uniform. However, for the same reason, the velocity profile had to be looked at very closely to find an optimum combination of bi-directional probes. The analysis indicated that acceptable HRR measurements can be obtained using an array of six thermocouples, four bi-directional velocity probes and a gas sampling grid. Results from the preliminary tests are presented. The system shows a reasonable estimate of the HRR as compared to the propane calibration burner.

AB  - The economic development in China and the rising of the living standard need to speed up the urbanisation. The development of small towns is an important way to Chinese urbanisation. Land use plays a very important role in the development of small towns. However there are many problems in the development of small towns, esp. in land use. The paper first discusses the land problems in the development of small towns. Such as much cultivated land lies idle, under-utilization and waste of land, increasing illegal use of land, unstable contractual relationship for land use. The relationship between the development of small towns and land use is also studied. Then the guidelines for the land system innovations of small towns are put forward. Namely the sustainability of social and economic development, the balance between land reservation and land utilization, the provision of service to village, agriculture and farmer, the management of land resource and land assets, the parsimonious and legal use of land. The basic framework of land system innovations of small towns is put forward finally. It include the land replacement policy for small towns and the permanent tenancy of farmland, the overall plan for land uses and other plans in harmony, the establishment of a flexible system of land supplies, using land with payments, the transfer of agricultural land and refining the land law related to the construction of small towns.

AB  - Uncertainty associated with fire-scar reconstructions of historical fire occurrence has led to questioning both estimates of frequency derived from these methods and the inferences on fire regimes drawn from these estimates. Using information from multiple, naturally-occurring fires (referred to as wildland fire use (WFU) fires) in two Sierra Nevada wilderness areas, we identified forest structural, topographic, and fire characteristics influencing fire scarring in trees and conducted direct comparisons of fire-scar reconstructed fire extent and frequency to fire atlas-based estimates of fire extent and frequency. The most important factor influencing the probability of sampled Pinus jeffreyi trees scarring from WFU fires was the length of time since previous fire. When intervals between successive fires are short, probabilities of scarring were low. Tree basal area and aspect were also significant factors explaining observed pattern of tree scarring. In all WFU fires but one, the reconstructed extent of fires was substantially smaller than the fire atlas extent. As a result, fire-scar reconstructed estimates of fire rotation were much longer than fire atlas fire rotation. This information can provide some necessary insight in interpreting and accounting for uncertainty in fire-scar reconstructions for drier low- to mid-elevation forest types throughout the western United States.

The primary concern is the relationship between land tenure and economic development, and land reform and the distribution of income, wealth and power. The main finding—that dispersed ownership and management correlate with economic development—is unsurprising. But it is more difficult to assess how conditions which are conducive to maximal production come about, or how a society shifts from concentrated power over land and labour to a dispersed tenure system.

The major effect of climate change on the coastal zone will be clue to increasing sea level which, in combination with possible increases in the frequency and intensity of storms, will bring about: change in patterns of erosion and sedimentation increased risk of flooding change in the distribution and types of coastal habitats. The coastline has always been subject to change through erosion and other natural Processes. Climate change may speed this change. This will mean profound impacts on low-lying coastal areas over the next 50 years, particularly along the eastern coast of England. These physical changes in the coastal zone will occur alongside, and interact with. a variety of human impacts and drivers of change. Agricultural policy reform, and changes in production in response to this and to climate change, will alter coastal landscapes as well as sediment and nutrient inputs into coastal waters. Demographic change - an increasing UK population, who are on average older and who potentially have more leisure time - will be likely to bring about an increased demand for the recreational opportunities that the coast provides. This will mean more demand for land for housing and recreational facilities. A continuing trend of rising income levels may also fuel further demand for imported goods and hence the need for further port development, particularly in the south east of England. Coastal landscapes are also likely to be heavily impacted by the construction of renewable energy infrastructure, i.e. offshore wind farms and wave and tidal power projects.

AB  - The vast tropical savanna region of northern Australia is generally flat, vegetated by native species and sparsely populated by people. The climate is typified as monsoonal, with contrasting wet and dry seasons. Temporal and spatial patterns of rainfall, cattle grazing, and fires help shape the vegetation of the region. Eucalyptus spp. dominate the tree cover while grasses are a feature of woodland understories. Grasses fuel fires which occur mostly in the dry season. Fire regimes (including between-fire interval, fire intensity, and season of occurrence) affect the relationships between the woody and grassy components of the vegetation. Fires, at a given point in the landscape, can occur with mean intervals as short as about two years but mean intervals vary widely across the region. Fire intensity varies seasonally: it can arbitrate between outcomes such as tree survival, shoot survival, or tree death. Introduced grasses, especially gamba grass (Andropogon gayanus), can alter fire regimes to the extent that the structure and composition of plant communities is strongly affected. Near major towns and cities, increased fire intensities due to gamba grass increases the fire threat to houses. Fire regimes, whether or not influenced by exotic species, affect land management for broad-scale pastoralism and biodiversity conservation, and influence carbon emissions and storage.

AB  - Environmental criminology theory has established that crime is non-random across time and space, instead clustering in specific, predictable ways. This has resulted in the development of theories that have helped generate a suite of highly effective, targeted crime prevention tools. Although access to high-quality temporal and spatial fire event data has improved in recent decades, the nexus between spatial/temporal clustering, theory, and targeted fire prevention remains largely unexplored. To address this, the current paper compares the temporal and spatial distributions of residential structure fire and residential burglary within a North American city over a three year period. This analysis reveals (a) overlapping spatial clustering for these two incident types, and (b) distinct temporal patterns; all of which can be explained by the logic underpinning environmental criminology theory. The extrapolation of these findings to targeted fire prevention is discussed with respect to the opportunity this presents for the fire service. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Old-growth forests are biologically and ecologically valuable systems\nthat are disappearing worldwide at a rapid rate. Mexico still holds\nlarge areas covered by temperate forests in the mountains of the Sierra\nMadre Occidental, but few of these retain old-growth characteristics. We\nstudied four sites with remnant old-growth forests in Mesa de las\nGuacamayas, a site in the Sierra Madre Occidental in northwestern\nChihuahua, to assess their composition, structure, and age\ncharacteristics. Overstory tree densities and basal areas at each site\nwere based on measurements of all trees >1.3 m tall. The overstory was\ndominated by large Pinus durangensis, P. strobiformis, and Pseudotsuga\nmenziesii (270-335 trees ha(-1), basal area 24-42 m(2) ha(-1)), with a\nsubcanopy formed mostly of oaks. This species composition, combined with\nthe lack of vertical structural development, and thus of fuel ladders,\nsuggests that these forests are relatively resistant to severe wildfire.\nWe evaluated forest attributes in the context of local fire regimes and\nregional climatic patterns, and found that frequent disturbance by\nsurface fires has been part of the study sites' histories for at least\n250 years. While climate was a driver of fire regimes historically in\nthis mountain range, humans appear to have played a role in\ninterruptions of the fire regime in the second half of the 20th century.\nAge distributions showed recruitment to the canopy over; similar to 250\nyears, while fires in the four sites recurred every 6-12 years.\nTemporary interruption of the fire regime in the mid-20th century at\nthree sites was associated with increased tree establishment, especially\nby broadleaved species. One site had an uninterrupted fire regime and\nshowed continuous tree establishment, consistent with the\nself-reinforcing role of frequent fire in regulating live and dead fuel\nloads. Remnant old-growth forests such as those we sampled are becoming\nincreasingly rare in the Sierra Madre Occidental. The biodiversity and\necological processes that they support are highly threatened and their\nconservation must be made a priority in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands.

AB  - Understanding the complexity of agricultural systems requires insight into the human-environment interactions. In this paper we used survey data to analyze land system change and its relation to farmer's attitudes in a typical agricultural region of Northeast China, focusing on land tenure, crop choice and intensification. Our survey shows that land transfer was fairly common across the study area: average farmland acreage per household almost doubled from 1.3. ha by early 1980s to 2.6. ha by early 2010s, especially due to urban migration of farmers. The survey indicates an increase in land transfers over time with a sharp decrease of the average period of land transfer contracts. Crop choice displays a trend of decreasing diversity as several cereal crops are no longer grown in the study region and the majority of bean cultivation has been replaced by maize and tobacco. Land transfers can explain part of these changes, butnot necessarily the full change to a dominance of a smaller number of crops at the region level. Irrigation intensity is related to the locations of rivers, while agricultural inputs, along with land transfer and crop allocation, show a spatial pattern which is related to road accessibility. Survey results show that two family characteristics (education level and the initially allocated land rights) and two socioeconomic factors (infrastructure and crop prices) are important in making land transfer decisions, while external factors such as market, policy, local cropping system, and agricultural disasters have substantially influenced crop choice decisions. The survey approach is very valuable to analyze land system changes from a stakeholder's perspective, especially in the absence of statistical data atfarm level. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Through testing PAR, temperature (t), relative humidity (RH), and CO2 concentration in the center and outside of the selected green lands, the ecological functions of the green lands on regulating city microclimate were analyzed. The results showed that except lawn, patch green lands had the function of shading. Green lands with plantation structure of tree + shrub + herb, tree, tree + herb, and shrub had greater effects on lowering temperature, increasing humidity, and adjusting CO2 concentration than that of lawn. Strip green lands also had certain effects on shading, lowering temperature, increasing humidity, and adjusting CO2 concentration. Among different plantation structures of stripe green lands, shrub had the best effect on shading, and tree + shrub had the best effects on lowering temperature, increasing humidity, and adjusting CO2 concentration. The ecological functions of patch green lands were better than those of strip green lands with the same plantation structure, and green lands with multistoried structure had greater ecological effects than those with single layer.

AB  - A systemic approach has been adopted to construct a fire-safety management system (FSMS). It has been applied to the case of an oil and gas organisation, although the approach is general. Significant changes have taken place in fire safety management in the oil and gas industry over the last few years. However, fire safety still tends to be analysed in isolation, though fire loss is a result of the interaction of the parts that constitute an oil and gas organisation as a whole. Fire loss may be seen as a 'systemic' failure, not a result of a single cause. This paper proposes a FSMS for an oil and gas organisation. The approach aims to help to maintain fire risk within an acceptable range in an oil and gas organisation's operations in a coherent way. It is hoped that this approach will lead not only to more effective management of fire safety in an oil and gas organisation, but also to more effective management of safety, health and the environment for any organisation.

AB  - In the complex agro-ecological conditions of Vietnam's northern borderlands, attempts by ethnic minority farmers to create sustainable livelihoods, along with the impacts of state development policies, have direct consequences for land use and land cover (LULC) change. In this paper we analyse the degree to which LULC has changed and diversified from 1999 to 2009 in Lào Cai Province and the underlying relationships with ethnic minority livelihood diversification strategies. We examine the correlation between LULC diversity and various socioeconomic and biophysical proxies using a spatial autoregressive model. Our findings indicate two major changes in LULC: an increase in closed canopy forest and substantial urban growth. LULC diversity increased between 1999 and 2009, suggesting a transition between land uses and/or a diversification of livelihood strategies. Socioeconomic proxies are significant predictors of LULC diversity in both years, while biophysical proxies are only effective predictors in 2009. In-depth interviews regarding state-led policies and ethnic minority livelihoods reveal some of the underlying mechanisms of such LULC transitions and associations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Changes in land use and land tenure can influence both physical fragmentation and ownership fragmentation of landscapes, with implications for biodiversity. In this study, we evaluated changes in land use and land tenure in the Tijuana River Watershed, a region of high biodiversity and endemism, following the implementation of a new Agrarian Law which allowed for privatization and sales of communal land (ejidos) beginning in 1992. In order to understand changes in land use and cover, we constructed maps from aerial photographs and Aster images and measured changes between 1994 and 2005. In order to understand changes in land tenure, we collected data from Mexican government sources on ejido land size, ownership, and sales, and we conducted 55 structured interviews with ejidatarios in the watershed. Our results demonstrate that land-use/cover change between 1994 and 2005 was dominated by an increase in urban area and grasslands, and a decrease in coastal sage scrub, chaparral, and, to a lesser degree, agriculture. In particular, the conversion of coastal sage scrub has left a far more fragmented landscape than existed in 1994. In addition, most of the ejidos in the watershed, as well as individuals interviewed, had participated in some stage of the land certification and titling process allowed by the new Agrarian Law, resulting in substantial changes in land tenure. However, land tenure security appeared to play a larger role than a desire to sell land and, contrary to studies from other regions, full title to the land was obtained in a range of urban and rural settings, rather than primarily on land closest to urban zones. Our results suggest that past predictions regarding future urban growth and fragmentation of native vegetation in the region have proven accurate and highlights regions of change that merit further study. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Tropical dry forests and savannas constitute more than half of all tropical forests and grasslands, but little is known about forest fire regimes within these two extensive types of ecosystems. Forest fire regimes in a predominantly dry forest in India, the Nilgiri landscape, and a predominantly savanna ecosystem in the Sathyamangalam landscape, were examined. Remote sensing data were applied to delineate burned areas, determine fire size characteristics, and to estimate fire-rotation intervals. Belt transects (0.5 ha) were used to estimate forest structure, diversity, and fuel loads. Mean area burned, mean number of fires, and mean fire size per year were substantially higher in the Nilgiri landscape compared to the Sathyamangalam landscape. Mean fire-rotational interval was 7.1 yr in the Nilgiri landscape and 44.1 yr in the Sathyamangalam landscape. Tree (>= 10 cm diameter at breast height) species diversity, tree density, and basal area were significantly higher in the Nilgiri landscape compared to the Sathyamangalam landscape. Total fuel loads were significantly higher in tropical dry and moist deciduous forests in the Nilgiri landscape, but total fuel loads were higher in the tropical dry thorn forests of the Sathyamangalam landscape. Thus, the two landscapes revealed contrasting fire regimes and forest characteristics, with more and four-fold larger fires in the Nilgiri landscape. The dry forests and savannas could be maintained by a combination of factors, such as fire, grazing pressures, and herbivore populations. Understanding the factors maintaining these two ecosystems will be critical for their conservation

In recent years,significant W-UI residential fire losses have occurred nationwide inthe United States that have focused attention on the principal W-UI problem—losses of life and property to fire. W-UI fires with significant residential losses differ from typical residential fires in that W-UI situations usually include the following:  • Large numbers of simultaneously exposed structures, • Rapid involvement of residential areas, • Overwhelmed fire-protection capabilities, and • Total loss of residence per structure ignited. Wildland vegetation fuels initially contribute to rapid fire growth. Large areas of burning that result can simultaneously expose numerous structures to flames and, most importantly, can rain firebrands (burning embers) on homes over a wide area. Although advances in firefighting technology and management have produced the most effective firefighting capabilities in history, these advances have not prevented large losses during recent W-UI fires. Severe W-UI fires can destroy whole neighborhoods in a few hours—much faster than the response time of the best firefighting services. Whether a W-UI fire occurs in Oakland, CA, as in 1991; Spokane, WA (in 1991); Grayling, MI (in 1990); or Palm Coast, FL (in 1985), it is similar to others nationwide. A recent example occurred in October 1993, when the Laguna Hills Fire in southern California destroyed— in 5 hours—nearly all the 366 homes lost during that fire. Because these fires swiftly overtake residential areas, many structures do not receive fire protection and suppression during severe W-UI fire situations. As a result, typical postfire statistics reveal that homes either survive or are totally destroyed. Relatively few structures suffer partial damage. The W-UI fire problem can be characterized as the exposure of a residence to flames and firebrands resulting in ignitions that produce widespread, extreme losses. If residential fire losses did not occur during wildland fires, the W-UI fire problem would not exist. Thus, the principal issue is residential structure survival.

AB  - With regard to the discussion by Elizabeth Pennisi (News Focus, 26 Mar. p. 2004) about the debate among anthropologists regarding the cooking of tubers by Homo erectus, whether or not they cooked tubers and/or meat, they certainly had the capacity for using fire, and thus, in principle, to cook. Not only is there considerable evidence for human association with fires before 240,000 years ago at Zhoukoudian in China, and in Africa at Chesnowanja and Swartkrans (1, 2), but a number of well-documented fireplaces have been recovered in the Okote tuff at Koobi Fora in Kenya, found by the late Glynn Isaac and Jack Harris; others were found later by Harry Merrick (3). These fireplaces have been dated by the potassium-argon method to approximately 1.6 million years ago and were undoubtedly made by humans, as they contain a mixture of woods, including easily ignited palm wood, used to make the fires. Charles Peters of the University of Georgia and I have a chapter on these fireplaces in a forthcoming volume in the Koobi Fora publications series (4). The most accessible report on these fireplaces (3) demonstrates differences between burned trees and the circular fireplaces not only among the H. erectus-associated remains—which included one irregular burned spot containing largely phytoliths of the same wood, thus apparently a burned tree—but also in present-day replications. Additional fireplaces excavated from the Okote tuff by Merrick at Koobi Fora have not yet been described in the literature. The relative thinness of the bone in the sides of the skull of H. erectus compared with that of earlier hominids, along with the smaller teeth, make it clear that H. erectus was doing something to make chewing easier. They clearly had the pyrotechnical ability to cook tubers at least as far back as 1.6 million years ago, even if further research must determine exactly what was cooking.

AB  - Human transformations of ecosystems and land systems are the largest source of change on Earth. Changes in land use and management affect the states, properties, and functions of land systems. That is, intensification and diversification of land use have led to rapid changes in, e.g. biogeochemical cycles, hydrologic processes, and landscape dynamics, which in turn influence human well-being. Thus, there is a need for improved understanding of these interlinked processes and what can be done to avert negative consequences. This calls for an approach that has been termed Integrated Assessment, or the ‘‘structured process of dealing with complex issues, using knowledge from various scientific disciplines and/or stakeholders, such that integrated insights are made available to decision makers’’ (Kok, 2006).

AB  - An accidental discharge of a total flooding Halon 1301 fire extinguishing system is described. The release of the Halon was accompanied by a sudden very loud noise, considerable air turbulence and a dense fog, resulting in worker anxiety and loss of visibility. The workers in the area at the time of the discharge reported higher frequencies of lightheadedness, headache, nasal complaints and disorientation than those entering the area later. Halon 1301 usually is regarded as having a low toxicity, although at concentrations above those used in occupied spaces, effects on consciousness and cardiac rhythm have been reported. In the present report no significant illness or injury due to the Halon exposure was found. A fine oily deposit found on horizontal surfaces in the area subsequent to the discharge consisted of mineral oil and iron, suggesting that this material was scoured out of the piping as the Halon discharged. The disorientation and anxiety produced by an accidental discharge can be minimized through education programs designed to ensure that personnel know what to expect and how to abort the discharge if it results from a false alarm. Situations leading to triggering of fire detectors by events other than fires should be investigated and reduced.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of shrimp farming on rice ecosystem in a village in Southwestern Bangladesh. The village Damarpota has experienced transformation of 274 ha (79%) of its prime quality rice fields into shrimp farms during the period between 1985 and 2003. Prolonged shrimp farming for 5-, 10-, and 15-year period has increased soil salinity, acidity, and depleted soil Ca, K, Mg, and organic C content of all three types of soils in the villages to a variable degree and caused soil degradation that significantly affected the rice yield. Declined yield and acreage of rice jointly reduced the total production of rice and animal fodder. Soil degradation and loss of acreage under rice have threatened the sustainability of the village rice ecosystem. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The different approaches that other countries take to land use reflect many national variables, including planning systems, institutional structures, socio-cultural characteristics, population pressures and environmental priorities. Literature reviews of relevant land-use issues in Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Sweden provided the background material for this paper. Other European countries appear to offer models of more pro-active and indicative land-use planning, in contrast to the adversarial system in the UK, and a much stronger regional focus. This seems to have made it easier to implement other policies, for example on renewable energy. Experience with liberalisation of agricultural markets, and the promotion of environmentally sustainable farming are both relevant to an increasingly polarised agricultural sector in the UK. Cutting across all these themes is a reflection on governance of land use. Of the countries considered, Sweden's focus on environmental sustainability, international responsibility and long-term consistency of direction appears to be most closely aligned to the coming land-use challenges. When drawing conclusions from this review it is important to bear in mind the effect of differences in bio-geographic factors, socio-economic conditions and political culture, both in other countries and within the UK. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - Fire is both an integral natural process in the California landscape and a growing threat to its urban and suburban development as it encroaches on wildlands. Written by many of the foremost authorities on the subject, this comprehensive volume, an ideal text and authoritative reference work, is the first to synthesize our knowledge of the science, ecology, and management of fire in California. Part I introduces the basics of fire ecology. It includes an historical synopsis of fire, vegetation, and climate in California; an overview of fire as a physical and ecological process; and a review of the interactions between fire and the physical, plant, and animal components of the environment. Part II explores the history and ecology of fire in each of California's nine bioregions. Part III examines fire management in California including both Native American and post-European settlement. Part III also covers current issues related to fire policy and management-including air quality, watershed management, invasive plant species, native species, and fuel management-and considers the future of fire management.

AB  - This paper, originally contributed as part of the government's Foresight investigation of Land Use Futures, considers the likely shape of policies affecting UK rural land use up to 2060, based on literature review, analysis of past and current trends and drivers, and discussion with selected policy experts. The postwar, centralised approach to spatial planning and countryside management has come under increasing challenge from domestic and international needs and concerns. European policy influence has increased in respect of agriculture and the natural environment. Zoning of land-use and a restrictive approach to built development have gradually weakened, and land-use drivers have become more multifunctional. Policy has moved away from a 'top-down' process designed in Whitehall towards a multi-layered structure within which international agreements and negotiations must be reconciled with regional and local, partnership-based approaches to planning and management, via national frameworks and a complex mix of regulatory and market-based instruments. Climate and energy policy, as well as policies on food and health, will require new and more diverse forms of development. A major challenge for the future could be the extent to which current, multi-layered spatial planning policies can accommodate the scale of change implied by the new mix of drivers from other policy areas. There is the possibility of an increasingly differentiated response across the UK countryside, as well as much more radical change in the system driven from the centre, as pressures increase.While the Government Office for Science commissioned this review, the views are those of the author, are independent of Government, and do not constitute Government policy. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Due to a unique combination of environmental conditions, the chaparral shrublands of southern California are prone to large, intense wildland fires. There is ongoing work in the fire research community to establish whether fuel accumulation or weather conditions are the determining factor in the prevalence of large chaparral fires. This study introduces a framework for contributing a modeling perspective to understanding these alternative hypotheses. As models formalize our understanding of the physical process of fire spread, the sensitivity of the models to the meteorological and fuel inputs should be indicators of their relative importance. A global sensitivity analysis (GSA) was conducted on HFire, a spatially explicit raster model developed for modeling fire spread in chaparral fuels, based on the Rothermel spread equations. The GSA provided a quantitative measure of the importance of each of the model inputs on the predicted fire size. The results indicate that, under extreme weather conditions, wind speed was over three times more influential on predicted fire sizes than any other single model input. This finding supports the idea that fires burning under Santa Ana conditions are primarily driven by high wind speeds. Future research will involve extending the GSA methodology to quantify the relative importance of these inputs in terms of the long-term fire regime in chaparral ecosystems.

AB  - This work details a framework developed to shorten the time needed to perform fire spread predictions. The methodology presented relies on a two-stage prediction strategy which introduces a calibration stage in order to relieve the effects of uncertainty on simulator input parameters. Early assessment of the response time and quality of the results obtained constitute a key component in this method. This automatic and intelligent process of identification of lengthy simulations that slow down the course of the predictions presents a very high hit ratio. However, discarding certain simulations from the adjustment process (based on evolutionary algorithms) could lead to loss of accuracy in our predictions. A strong statistical study to analyze the impact of this action on our final predictions is reported. This study is based on a real fire which burnt 13,000ha in the region of Catalonia (north-east of Spain) in the summer of 2012. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Amazon is being rapidly transformed by fire. Logging and forest fragmentation sharply elevate fire incidence by increasing forest desiccation and fuel loads, and forests that have experienced a low-intensity surface fire are vulnerable to far more catastrophic fires. Satellites typically detect thermal signatures from 40 000 to 50 000 separate fires in the Amazon each year, and this number could increase as new highways and infrastructure expand across the basin. Many are concerned that large-scale deforestation, by reducing regional evapo-transpiration and creating moisture-trapping smoke plumes, will make the basin increasingly vulnerable to fire. The Amazon may also be affected by future global warming and atmospheric changes, although much remains uncertain. Most models suggest the basin will become warmer throughout this century, although there is no consensus about how precipitation will be affected. The most alarming scenarios project a permanent disruption of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, leading to greatly increased drought or destructive synergisms between regional and global climate change in the Amazon.

AB  - The majority of studies on Chinese urbanization have been focused on coastal areas, with little attention given to urban centers in the west. Western provinces, however, will unquestionably undergo significant urban change in the future as a result of the 'Go West' policy initiated in the 1990s. In this paper the authors examine the relationship between drivers of urban growth and land-use outcomes in Chengdu, capital of the western province of Sichuan, China. In the first part of this research, remotely sensed data are used to map changes in land cover in the greater Chengdu area and to investigate the spatial distribution of development with use of landscape metrics along seven urban-to-rural transects identified as key corridors of growth. Results indicate that the urbanized area increased by more than 350% between 1978 and 2002 in three distinct spatial trends: (a) near the urban fringe in all directions prior to 1990, (b) along transportation corridors, ring roads, and near satellite cities after 1990, and, finally, (c) infilling in southern and western areas (connecting satellite cities to the urban core) in the late 1990s. In the second part of this paper the authors connect patterns of growth with economic, land, and housing market reforms, which are explored in the context of urban planning initiatives. The results reveal that, physically, Chengdu is following trends witnessed in coastal cities of China, although the importance of various land-use drivers differs from that in the east (for example, in the low level of foreign direct investment to date). The information provided by the land-use analysis ultimately helped tailor policies and plans for better land management and reduced fragmentation of new development in the municipality

The computer controls a focusing motor, which cycles the microscope through different focal planes. For each focal plane, an image is collected from a video camera, digitized, and stored (in a somewhat compressed format) on a high capacity magnetic disk drive. In a typical experiment lineaging a single embryo, images would be taken in each of 25 consecutive focal planes in a cycle, with each cycle lasting 30 seconds. The current system (with 2.5 gigabytes of disk storage) can accommodate approximately 18,000 full frame images: six hours of continuous recording at maximum resolution. Once recorded, images stored on the disk can be 'played back' in any order. Generally a series from a single focal plane is played consecutively in either forward or reverse time. The focal plane can be controlled during playback (using keyboard or joystick), allowing individual cells to be followed as they move between focal planes. Theoretical playback rates are as fast as 60 full frame images per second, but currently the system can only run at a fraction of this rate (3-5 full frame images per second). Although rapid playback is useful for general impressions of developmental events, precise lineaging generally involves using the keypad to step through time and focal planes to follow single cells. Image series can be archived by copying information from the magnetic disks onto digital tape. An image series stored on tape can be restored at any time by recopying the data onto the hard disk of the system. Each digital tape holds about 40,000 full frame images, costs $5 and can be rewritten multiple times. A disadvantage of digital tape archiving is a waiting time of 1-3 hours for an archived image series to be copied from tape back to disk. When compared to the magnetic tapes that we are using, the analog LaserDisks used to store images in the White/Biorad system have some advantages and disadvantages: LaserDisks can be readily interchanged, provide rapid access to 43,500 images per side, and provide faster playback rates. Unfortunately the LaserDisks cannot be erased or rewritten and are costly (around $200 each; the laserdisk recorder is also considerably more expensive than magnetic disk and tape drives). Unprocessed image quality should be comparable for analog and digital storage systems. The digital system allows for more sophisticated image enhancement and analysis techniques, but at present we are using only very simple image averaging and contrast enhancement. This gives screen images almost equivalent to viewing specimens directly through the microscope. While early lineages can easily be followed with the system as it is now working, later lineages (i.e. the last two cell divisions) are more difficult to follow reliably. Current efforts aimed at improving image resolution and data compression should facilitate later lineaging. A second type of experiment for which the setup has been used is to follow large groups (10-30) of embryos at lower magnification (nomarski observation with a 20 or 40x objective; generally 8-12 focal planes recorded for 12-14 hr series). At this resolution one can observe early cleavages, cell movements, morphogenesis and embryonic muscle function. Being able to follow embryos in retrospect (e.g. only those embryos that fail to hatch) facilitates analyses of the earliest defects and course of development of zygotic lethal mutations and deficiencies. A parts list and the software driving the system are available. Because our system is pieced together and includes some older equipment from the Carnegie attic, duplication would require some mechanical tinkering and likely some programming.

AB  - I have assembled an image archive system based in principle on John White's '4D microscope' (now marketed by BioRad) but differing in that images are stored digitally as opposed to the analog LaserDisk storage used in the White/BioRad system. Message: internal system error : Malloc error at 10041a8c length 256: end overwritten with 345678 Message: internal system error : Malloc error at 10041a8c length 256: end overwritten with 345678 Our archive system is based on a relatively inexpensive computer (a 'clone' of an IBM type PC). The computer controls a focusing motor, which cycles the microscope through different focal planes. For each focal plane, an image is collected from a video camera, digitized, and stored (in a somewhat compressed format) on a high capacity magnetic disk drive. In a typical experiment lineaging a single embryo, images would be taken in each of 25 consecutive focal planes in a cycle, with each cycle lasting 30 seconds. The current system (with 2.5 gigabytes of disk storage) can accommodate approximately 18,000 full frame images: six hours of continuous recording at maximum resolution. Once recorded, images stored on the disk can be 'played back' in any order. Generally a series from a single focal plane is played consecutively in either forward or reverse time. The focal plane can be controlled during playback (using keyboard or joystick), allowing individual cells to be followed as they move between focal planes. Theoretical playback rates are as fast as 60 full frame images per second, but currently the system can only run at a fraction of this rate (3-5 full frame images per second). Although rapid playback is useful for general impressions of developmental events, precise lineaging generally involves using the keypad to step through time and focal planes to follow single cells. Image series can be archived by copying information from the magnetic disks onto digital tape. An image series stored on tape can be restored at any time by recopying the data onto the hard disk of the system. Each digital tape holds about 40,000 full frame images, costs $5 and can be rewritten multiple times. A disadvantage of digital tape archiving is a waiting time of 1-3 hours for an archived image series to be copied from tape back to disk. When compared to the magnetic tapes that we are using, the analog LaserDisks used to store images in the White/Biorad system have some advantages and disadvantages: LaserDisks can be readily interchanged, provide rapid access to 43,500 images per side, and provide faster playback rates. Unfortunately the LaserDisks cannot be erased or rewritten and are costly (around $200 each; the laserdisk recorder is also considerably more expensive than magnetic disk and tape drives). Unprocessed image quality should be comparable for analog and digital storage systems. The digital system allows for more sophisticated image enhancement and analysis techniques, but at present we are using only very simple image averaging and contrast enhancement. This gives screen images almost equivalent to viewing specimens directly through the microscope. While early lineages can easily be followed with the system as it is now working, later lineages (i.e. the last two cell divisions) are more difficult to follow reliably. Current efforts aimed at improving image resolution and data compression should facilitate later lineaging. A second type of experiment for which the setup has been used is to follow large groups (10-30) of embryos at lower magnification (nomarski observation with a 20 or 40x objective; generally 8-12 focal planes recorded for 12-14 hr series).

AB  - In current practice, very few Metropolitan Planning Agencies attempt to capture the effects of transportation system changes on land use, and the consequent feedback effects on transportation system performance, despite substantial evidence that these effects may be significant. In this paper, we present a case study on the application of UrbanSim, a detailed land use simulation model system, and its integration with a regional travel demand model in the Greater Wasatch Front area of Utah. Like several other metropolitan areas, this region has recently been confronted with legal challenges to proposed highway projects, drawing substantial scrutiny to the land use-transportation connection. We describe the UrbanSim model specification, results from model estimation, and sensitivity analyses conducted with the combined land use and travel model system. The results of the sensitivity analysis suggest that accounting for the land use effects of a regional transportation plan may produce significant shifts in key transportation evaluation measures such as vehicle miles traveled, vehicle hours traveled, and hours of congestion delay. ?? 2006.

AB  - Transportation decisions clearly affect land-use patterns, and land-use decisions clearly affect transportation systems. Urban theorists have addressed the cyclical land-usetransportation relationship for many decades and economists have modeled it extensively. Field studies demonstrate what the economists have predicted and what many theorists have feared: that, in many ways, highways shape urban areas. Yet little of that knowledge has found its way into planning practice, and land-use planning and transportation planning remain separate decision-making processes. Now that Congress has mandated that transportation planners consider both land-use plans and the land-use impacts of their decisions, the literature of planning practice should draw on the theoretical and research literature and provide guidance to planners on how to manage the transportation-land-use cycle.

AB  -   This paper demonstrates a method for prestress optimization of tensegrity structures resulting in their optimal mixed dynamic and control performance. Prestress of a structure is parameterized using force-density variables that appear linearly in its linearized dynamic model. A feasible region for these parameters is defined in terms of the extreme directions of the prestress cone. A numerical method is proposed for computing this particular basis for the structure prestress cone. The problem is solved using a gradient method based on the sensitivity analysis. A numerical example of a cantilevered planar tensegrity beam is shown.

AB  - The health and function of forest ecosystems throughout the world include periodic exposure to disturbances such as fire. Fire has been instrumental in the evolution of large segments of flora and fauna and in preventing fuel accumulations that resulted in extreme fire behaviour and ecosystem degradation. However, wildland fuels have been accumulating over several of the past decades because of suppression-orientated wildland fire policies, silvicultural and grazing practices, invasions of invasive species, increased density and range of flammable indigenous plants, landscape fragmentation, and related natural and anthropogenic causes. The additional fuels have contributed to increased severe fire behaviour, fire intensity, forest mortality, and post-fire soil damage and erosion. The aftermath of severe wildland fires include ecosystems degraded by extreme fire temperatures and duration, reductions in ecosystem function, altered forest structure, altered natural fire regimes, and increased wildfire risk and imminent threats to life and property from uncontrollable fires. We review 10 years of advances in fire science in the eight papers presented in this Special Issue. The studies and reviews are compiled to present the diverse disciplines of fire science that range from the social science of the public's perception of fire to basic research on the theory of fire spread.

AB  - Urban land use has been a major driving force behind land use change in Estonia since regaining independence and land reform process in the 1990s. The study summarizes land use change, land management and planning practices in the urban fringe over a period of 20 years with the aim of introducing a sustainable land use policy in highly fragmented suburban land. The processes and dynamics of land use change are explored using cartographic and landscape metrics analysis. The liberal-conservative planning practices have resulted in ad hoc allocation solutions which have created dramatic changes in land use in Estonia during the 1990s and 2000s. The patchy and scattered suburban land is formed by occupying former agricultural land, natural grasslands and forests. In the framework of physical planning, the land use, spatial and urban changes are related to master plans. The nature of the evolution of land management and the deficiencies of institutional framework are discussed as factors in inefficient land use in the sprawling suburbs. A further debate on the feasibility of encouraging land use diversity in peri-urban zones is advocated. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The rate of fire growth in a real scale fire test is estimated using an inverse modelling approach of computational fire dynamics (FDS v5). Measurements from the fire test are assimilated into the fire model and based on this the parameters of a decoupled fire growth model are estimated. A forecast of the fire development is then made with the estimated parameters. It is shown that a simplified fire growth model can give a robust representation of the underlying physics and that the necessary parameters can be estimated at an acceptable computational cost. The forecasts are shown to accurately predict the fire development. The results are based on a simplified single parameter fire growth model of a well characterized scenario, but the methodology allows for an extension to a more complicated model that would require less previous characterization of the fire scenario.

In Southeast Asia the occurrence of fires is generally associated with increasing rainfall seasonality. In aseasonal lowland rainforests fire is rare, but potentially devastating when it occurs.  In the strongly seasonal regions of continental Southeast Asia deciduous forests and savannas may burn at low intensity every few years, but have little impact on the majority of trees.   Between these two extremes of rainfall seasonality lie landscapes dominated by mosaics of evergreen and deciduous forests for which the role of fire and its potential impacts are poorly understood.   Ecologists and conservationists across the region have expressed concern that changing fire regimes due to increasing human pressures and potential climate change may lead to a substantial loss of the evergreen forest component within these mosaics.   However, there are few empirical data to address these concerns and to use in the development of robust landscape-scale fire management plans.   Here we describe results from a study on the fire ecology of forests at the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary in western Thailand that was conducted in the wake of the 1998 ENSO fires that occurred there. We compared fire behavior, tree mortality, and stand-scale impacts of the fires across the three dominant forest types of the region: seasonal evergreen forest, mixed deciduous forest, and deciduous dipterocarp forest. Our data demonstrate that the fires are mostly low-intensity surface fires that generate a low level of mortality across the landscape. Mortality was primarily a function of tree size with 50% mortality occurring in trees ~2 cm DBH (diameter at breast height).   We found no evidence of heightened sensitivity to fire in the seasonal evergreen forest and suggest that the high levels of mortality among evergreen tree species in Bornean forests are indicative of differences in long-term exposure to fire between the seasonal evergreen forests of the continent and the aseasonal evergreen forests of insular Southeast Asia. We discuss these findings in the context of the design and implementation of fire management practices in the seasonal tropical forests of continental Southeast Asia.

In this paper the state of the art in these techniques is reviewed with examples illustrating the use of fire statistics in evaluating the parameters of these models. Methods discussed include exponential model of fire growth, probability distribution of damage, and stochastic model of fire spread. The estimates provided by these models can be used in conjunction with an engineering method for a probabilistic treatment of deterministic predictions.

AB  - Various protocols for permeabilization and staining of adult C. elegans in such a way as to avoid killing embryos in the uterus have been described (Sebastiano et al Genetics 112 459, AF WBG 9#2, Stone and Shaw WBG 10#3 p27, Candido MRC lore). I have been trying to optimize this procedure to obtain strong, well localized staining of lines carrying -gal fusion proteins, to allow for selection of altered staining patterns after mutagenesis. A current protocol is described below. The treatment is somewhat more drastic than previous methods, but allows excellent staining and reasonable preservation with survival of 3-5 embryos per stained adult. 1. Pellet animals from H20 and resuspend in 50% acetone for 10-15 min at room temp (the time for this step is critical...too long and embryos are inviable, too short and the adults fail to permeabilize and awaken in the staining solution.). 2. Wash animals 3x in PMB and resuspend in staining mix. Stain at room temperature. The hatched animals can survive within the adult in staining solution for several hours, but eventually die or free themselves, limiting staining time to about 12 hr. 3. Scoring with a dissecting microscope is best with epi-illumination over a white background PMB: 50mM NaPi pH 7.5, 1mM MgCl2 Staining Mix: PMB + 10mM KFerrocyanide + 10mM KFerricyanide + .004% SDS + 10 l/ml of 12.5% XGAL in DMF (XGAL stock should be stored at - 70 C) Optimal permeabilization so far has been around 95% of animals. Thus the technique could be used to screen for ectopic expression or expression of an otherwise inactive construct, but loss of expression would be difficult to screen for. N.B. Some permeabilization of pharyngeal muscle occurs without the acetone step (putting animals directly into staining solution).

AB  - Various protocols for permeabilization and staining of adult C. elegans in such a way as to avoid killing embryos in the uterus have been described (Sebastiano et al Genetics 112 459, AF WBG 9#2, Stone and Shaw WBG 10#3 p27, Candido MRC lore). I have been trying to optimize this procedure to obtain strong, well localized staining of lines carrying -gal fusion proteins, to allow for selection of altered staining patterns after mutagenesis. A current protocol is described below. The treatment is somewhat more drastic than previous methods, but allows excellent staining and reasonable preservation with survival of 3-5 embryos per stained adult. 1. Pellet animals from H20 and resuspend in 50% acetone for 10-15 min at room temp (the time for this step is critical...too long and embryos are inviable, too short and the adults fail to permeabilize and awaken in the staining solution.). 2. Wash animals 3x in PMB and resuspend in staining mix. Stain at room temperature. The hatched animals can survive within the adult in staining solution for several hours, but eventually die or free themselves, limiting staining time to about 12 hr. 3. Scoring with a dissecting microscope is best with epi-illumination over a white background PMB: 50mM NaPi pH 7.5, 1mM MgCl2 Staining Mix: PMB + 10mM KFerrocyanide + 10mM KFerricyanide + .004% SDS + 10 l/ml of 12.5% XGAL in DMF (XGAL stock should be stored at - 70 C) Optimal permeabilization so far has been around 95% of animals. Thus the technique could be used to screen for ectopic expression or expression of an otherwise inactive construct, but loss of expression would be difficult to screen for. N.B. Some permeabilization of pharyngeal muscle occurs without the acetone step (putting animals directly into staining solution).

AB  - In this study, a model for recognition degree of refuge areas by Kyoto City residents in post-earthquake fire event was developed based on the data obtained by an interview survey. When a large earthquake hits a city in Japan, a tremendous number of evacuees may wander around in urban area escaping from hazards due to conflagrations following the earthquake. We have been developing a simulation model for city evacuation of residents in post-earthquake fire as a tool to evaluate effectiveness of evacuation safety measures. For the further refinement, it is important to accurately estimate evacuation destination of residents considering bias of recognition degree of refuge areas. The interview survey was carried out at 104 spots on busy streets in Kyoto City and replies from 2,267 residents were collected from September 1st to November 30th, 2009. In the interview, the names of open-spaces recognized as evacuation destination were asked having the subjects imagine that conflagrations had taken place in urban area. The governing factors of recognition degree of refuge areas were identified and evacuation destination of a resident was formulated by adopting a probabilistic model.

AB  - Fire behavior predictions, as well as measures of uncertainty in those predictions, are essential in operational and strategic fire management decisions. While it is becoming common practice to assess uncertainty in fire behavior predictions arising from variability in weather inputs, uncertainty arising from the fire models themselves is difficult to assess. This is the case with fires in crown fuels and the operational fire behavior models used in the United States, where model assumptions, such as fuel homogeneity and steady-state spread, limit the capability of those models to provide reliable results, possibly leading to uncertainties of unknown magnitude. An emerging body of work with dynamic physics-based fire models illustrates the capabilities of those models to address potentially important factors that are not considered by operational models, such as fuel heterogeneity and transitional behaviors. In this investigation we used a dynamic, physics-based fire model, FIRETEC, to explore variability in the forward spread rate of a fire arising from spatial variability in crown fuels. We generated 25 different spatial configurations of trees with four different clumping patterns, for a total of 100 different simulated forest stands. Using FIRETEC we simulated fire through each of these stands, holding the ignition and weather inputs constant. Analyses assessed differences in spread rates between clumping groups and arising from differences in canopy cover and total fuel, as well as differences in variability in spread rate between clumping groups. Differences in spread rates between groups and due to canopy cover and total fuel were not significant, largely due to high variability within groups; differences in variance in spread rate between clumping groups was statistically significant (p-value 0.0007). Variability in spread rate increased substantially as gaps between tree clumps got larger, with > 60% difference in overall spread rate observed between the lowest rate of spread and the highest rate of spread. Results suggest a certain inherent unpredictability in fire behavior that can largely be attributed to fine scale fire-fuel-atmosphere interactions which are by their nature difficult to predict beforehand. Self-determining physical fire models do not predict, but rather observe outcomes; however, ensemble runs with physical fire models can be used to quantify variability in fire behavior arising from sources that are not considered by operational models. Our study suggests a need for a paradigm shift in fire behavior modeling which emphasizes identifying sources of variability and estimating their magnitude over pure prediction of spread rates.

AB  - A land use and transportation interaction model was developed for the Sacramento, California, region, using the MEPLAN framework. The model represents land markets directly together with location-choice processes of different industry and household categories and the interactions among them. These resulting economic interactions lead to trip matrixes that are assigned to a multimodal, capacity-restrained transportation network, generating travel times and disutilities that influence the location-choice process in the period from 1990 to 2015. A range of different policy options is simulated for that period. Five different scenarios are compared with a trend scenario, three representing different long- and short-term government transportation supply scenarios, one representing incentives and disincentives to encourage land use patterns complementary to an improved transit system, and one combining the land-incentive scenario with higher prices for private vehicle use. The scenario predictions differ in mode choice, firm location, residential location, development patterns, vehicle kilometers traveled, and land rents. Various land uses are seen to be bidding against each other, and the differences in spatial arrangements between scenarios are quite complex and demonstrate the richness of the model. Certain changes take time to develop, demonstrating the need for a long-term approach to planning.

AB  - Fire, in conjunction with landforms and climate, shapes the structure and function of forests throughout the Western United States, where millions of acres of forest lands contain accumulations of flammable fuel that are much higher than historical condi- tions owing to various forms of fire exclusion. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act mandates that public land managers assertively address this situation through active management of fuel and vegetation. This document synthesizes the relevant scientific knowledge that can assist fuel-treatment projects on national forests and other public lands and contribute to National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analyses and other assessments. It is intended to support science-based decisionmaking for fuel manage- ment in dry forests of the Western United States at the scale of forest stands (about 1 to 200 acres). It highlights ecological principles that need to be considered when man- aging forest fuel and vegetation for specific conditions related to forest structure and fire hazard. It also provides quantitative and qualitative guidelines for planning and implementing fuel treatments through various silvicultural prescriptions and surface- fuel treatments. Effective fuel treatments in forest stands with high fuel accumulations will typically require thinning to increase canopy base height, reduce canopy bulk density, reduce canopy continuity, and require a substantial reduction in surface fuel through prescribed fire or mechanical treatment or both. Long-term maintenance of desired fuel loadings and consideration of broader landscape patterns may improve the effectiveness of fuel treatments.

AB  -  The machine design process usually covers two different engineering domains: structure design and system control. The relationship between these two domains is very closed. In order to reduce the disturbance caused by parameters in either one, the domain knowledge from those two different fields needs to be integrated. So the technique of multi-object optimization will be applied to achieve multiple design objectives. To investigate the method for integrated optimization, we will use the machine tools, which are the most output in our country, as a design platform. First of all, application software of Pro/E and AnSys will be used to build the 3D model to analyze and design structure parameters based on their effect and sensitivity to the controller. Therefore, physical properties of the machine tool will be obtained. Matlab will also be applied to determine proper control parameters for the system. Finally, the technology of multi-object optimization design for machine tools will be fully established and the corresponding production competitivity is expected to be greatly raised.

AB  - This paper is an exploration of the thesis that preemption has recuperated the faltering logic of sovereignty. In this recuperative sense, preemption redeems the image of modern state sovereignty while becoming the new governing logic or decision-making process. Whereas the decision making process of sovereignty tends to be organized around a spatial practice (the exception) preemption is organized around a temporal decision making mechanism (contingency). Brian Massumi has noted that deterrence, the spatial strategy of modern sovereign states par excellence, is being replaced by preemption, which constitutes a new horizon of being in the world.2 This shift cannot be understood as a postmodern turn, a bad foreign policy or the sign of a corrupt American administration.3 Instead, preemption demands a rethinking of the central enabling concepts of modern political life, in general, and the concept of sovereignty, in particular.

AB  - One of the key requirements of the European Union (EU) for accession of Central European countries (CEC) to the EU is the establishment of free market economies which parallel the economies in Western Europe based on the adoption of the Acquis Communautaire (Acquis) from the EU. Central to this objective is the privatisation of lands and the establishment of efficient land markets. To this end the EU and many other countries and international organisations have committed significant resources to support land administration, and particularly cadastral projects, in Central Europe since 1992. This paper reviews the role that the establishment of land administration systems is playing in the accession of CEC to the EU. Other key requirements for accession to the EU are the adoption of the Common Agricultural Policy, the protection of human rights, environmental sustainability and institution building. The paper also considers the role that land administration plays in supporting these objectives and develops a generic framework for land administration projects in support of accession to the EU. As background the paper uses examples to highlight the historical context of land, the evolution of land administration in Central Europe, the reconstruction of property rights and the justification of land administration projects in the context of AGENDA 2000 for a wider Europe. The paper provides an international context by examining land administration trends globally. The paper concludes by highlighting the challenges facing the establishment of land administration systems in CEC. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, the use of visioning processes and scenario-planning tools for developing regional land-use scenarios has become rather common. Typically, visioning is performed as a cooperative, inclusive process among business owners, community residents, interest groups, and local officials, and results in broad goals and principles which can guide future policies and plans. This is a very different approach than a land-use modeling process, which is typically generated by technical experts and results in a set of probable future trends and indicators which can guide the implementation of growth management strategies. The scenario-planning tools typically used for visioning processes are designed to generate and compare potential and preferred future development scenarios based on stakeholder values and preferences, whereas land-use models are used to predict likely future development patterns based on mathematical equations, reflecting historical trends, and market forces. Consequently, direct comparisons of results for the two methods are not really relevant. However, it is important to understand how the two approaches differ and that both offer their own relative advantages from a planning perspective. In an effort to better appreciate what each approach offers, this paper compares and contrasts these two methods, featuring the Austin metropolitan statistical area as a case study. The preferred vision, produced by the Envision Central Texas organization, offers the greatest potential for public involvement in identifying regional development goals for the future. The land-use models have a strong theoretical foundation and allow for interactions with a transportation model. Moreover, the land-use models have the potential to identify key strategies that can be used in achieving the region's goals. Thus, the combination of these two approaches seems to offer the greatest opportunities for planners to achieve a future that accommodates all stakeholders.  2008 ASCE.

AB  - Land and water resource issues typically fall under separate governance systems. For example, agricultural policy regulates land-cover change while water departments regulate water quality. However, land-use changes can directly affect water resources. Water flow regulation is a key service which is affected by changes in land-cover but its dynamics are poorly understood by most policy makers and land management organisations. We simulated and quantified the effects of plant invasions on land-cover, hydrological soil characteristics and catchment responsiveness on flow regulation using a hydrological model. The case study was located in the indigenous fynbos shrublands in South Africa. Fynbos requires fire to regenerate, has moderate biomass, occurs mostly in areas with a potential to erode and is prone to invasion by woody plant species, particularly trees. Invasions can affect flow regulation by changing community structure and function and increasing fuel loads. The greater fuel load increases fire intensity and severity which, in turn, changes the hydrological responses of catchments. Few studies have assessed the effects of invasion on hydrological responses but studies on plantations have recorded significant increases in soil water repellence following fire, resulting in increased overland flow similar to impacts of fires in invaded areas. Simulation of clear-felling of pines and different degrees of water repellency increased both the responsiveness of the catchment to rainfall and extreme rainfall events. The simulated fire effects were consistent with other studies of hydrological responses to fire. Our study indicates that invasions of pines and acacias in the study area could substantially increase the risk of flood damage even from moderate rainfall events, and highlights the importance of maintaining flow regulation capacity. New policy approaches are required which take account of the linkages and interactions between land-use choices, water resources and ecosystem services, and address them when considering governance arrangements. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

What factors should be considered if the model applied to China model. What is the impact of North Korea's unification of land system change. I was studied to review this China's urban land reform and the reform of collective land. Rural land system in China has been stipulated in Land Management Act enacted in 1986. And collective land use rights of farmers are included the Law of Reality in 2007. North Korea was carried out the land reform according to the theory of socialism in 1946. However, in the early 1990s, the constant change has emerged from the process of the collapse of the socialist bloc, deconstruction, and seeking survival. North Korea was first introduced in the land lease system for Free Economic and Trade Zone Rajin. In 1993, North Korea was adopted land lease law. However North Korea is limited land use coverage to foreigners and foreign companies. This can be described as a defensive strategy for reducing the system according to the open-threatening elements. However, legal system of Free Economic and Trade Zone will be spread North Korea through a constant process in all areas from the perspective of China. North Korea shall establish a strategy for the movement of labor and land system to time of openness and reform. Land system is the deciding factor of success or failure for North Korea's reform and openness. If China is not prepared properly countermeasures on the experience issues, North Korea will face to the great crisis. Therefore North Korea is a need to adopt land use rights system of the Chinese-Model. North Korea can take advantage of the land rent for national resources and the costs of unification. Also, at the unification, there is a need to review the rural land for the permanent rental system and shareholders of the land.]

AB  - This study examines the impact of uncertainty in the land use component of a partially integrated land use-transportation modeling system called UrbanSim. Outputs from the land use model (LUM) act as inputs for a traditional 4-step travel demand model (TDM), and travel times from the traffic-assignment stage of the TDM are fed forward into the subsequent years LUM. This work examines the propagation of uncertainty across model stages as well as at each model stage over time. A factorized design approach is used to model uncertainty in demographic inputs (which include aggregate growth rates and mobility rates) to the land use model, as well as uncertainty in various model parameters. The results suggest that while several model inputs may affect model outputs in the short run, only those inputs that have a cumulative effect are likely to have a significant impact on outputs in the long run. The results also suggest that uncertainty in model outputs may increase for the first few years for which the model is run, as modified inputs send shocks through the urban system. However, the level of uncertainty appears to come down in later years, as households, jobs, and developers respond to changed input conditions

AB  - Food security remains an ongoing global concern: the challenge of ensuring food availability, access, and utility for all, at all times, is yet to be met. The body of literature relating to food security is grow- ing immensely. Land administrators are part of the discourse. Their arguments are spread disparately across academic and professional publications. The distinction between scientific work and political rhetoric is increasingly blurry: the role of land administration needs to be more concisely articulated. This paper provides a new synthesis on the relationships between land administration and food security. It undertakes a review of land administration literature relating to food security. It aims at crystallizing understandings of how land administration supports, or fails to support, food security at a conceptual level, and also the strategic and operational levels of land administration systems. The relationship between land administration and food security appears to be conceptually agreed upon; however, at operational levels the link is less evident. Conceptually, land administration is argued to deliver (and sometimes not deliver) secure land tenure, support for implementation of agricultural policies, access to credit, less litigation, easier land dealings, land taxation, land inventories, and land transaction con- trols. This enables (or undermines) subsistence farming, development of local agricultural sectors and markets, credit to access to non-local food markets, farm subsidization, more efficient land utiliza- tion, fairer international investments, and national food planning strategies. In general, the examined literature tends to focus on problem identification rather than system design. Additionally, the large amount of positive viewpoints need better validation in many cases. Future work needs to concentrate on examining the utility of land information and geospatial tools for food security, extracting lessons from the land administration systems of developed contexts, and improving the links at an operational level.

AB  - China has extremely scarce land resources compared to the world average. There is an urgent need for studies of the current situation and the trends in land-use change and assessment of the performance of land policies in China. Assessment of land-use change has long been hindered by a lack of accurate and reliable data. This paper uses the data obtained from the national land surveys of 1996 and land-use change surveys from 1997 to 2008, to analyze changes in land use and the policy dimension driving forces related to the changes, especially cultivated land, forestry land, grassland, as well as developed land. The aim of this analysis will be to derive the physical, social and economical driving forces of those changes to grasp the trends in land-use change and the effects of land policies and to formulate strategies for the protection and sustainable use of agricultural land. The results indicate that, although the overall change in land use was not large, cultivated land was significantly reduced and developed land rapidly increased. A great deal of high quality cultivated land was changed to developed land and low quality cultivated land generated from unused land, which has resulted in a serious threat to food supplies in China. Predictions using the methods of linear extrapolation and a BP neural network indicate that it is impossible to keep to a target of 0.12 billion hectares of cultivated land in the future under the mode of economic development used between 1996 and 2008. The results also indicate that the implementation of the laws and regulations about controlling the developed land and preserving cultivated land had significant effects on changes in land use, especially cultivated land and developed land. The results suggest that the changes in land use are closely related to economic fluctuation and the enaction and implementation of these land policies had a little time lag for cultivated land protection. There is a pressing need for China to use its limited land resources more efficiently and effectively by enacting or re-enforcing the laws and regulations on land resources protection and economic development, not only for its own growing population, but also the world. Therefore, we must formulate strategies for the protection and sustainable use of agricultural land. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The results also indicate that the implementation of the laws and regulations about controlling the developed land and preserving cultivated land had significant effects on changes in land use, especially cultivated land and developed land. The results suggest that the changes in land use are closely related to economic fluctuation and the enaction and implementation of these land policies had a little time lag for cultivated land protection. There is a pressing need for China to use its limited land resources more efficiently and effectively by enacting or re-enforcing the laws and regulations on land resources protection and economic development, not only for its own growing population, but also the world. Therefore, we must formulate strategies for the protection and sustainable use of agricultural land. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Integrated Water Resource Management is a risk based approach advocating the co-ordinated development and management of land and water resources in order to ensure sustainable development. Water is central in the production of most forms of energy, and, as finite freshwater supplies become scarcer as a result of population growth and climate change, energy is becoming increasing pivotal in the provision of water. However, the energy, climate and water sectors remain largely disconnected in terms of policy and decision making. This poses a problem for the holistic and sustainable management of water resources. This report is a study of how the approach of Integrated Water Resource Management applies to areas of water and energy in a predicted climate change scenario. It has two primary purposes. Firstly, to raise discussion amongst Australian policy setters and decision makers involved in the fields of water, energy and climate. Secondly, it fulfils the requirements of a three month research project as part of the Masters of Integrated Water Management program being hosted by the International WaterCentre. The main objectives of this report are to investigate the links and policy settings associated with water, energy and climate change at a Global, Australian National and State level and, through the utilisation of an Integrated Water Resource Management approach, to provide a way forward in identifying, mitigating and adapting to the various risks that these nexus may present. The research involved an analysis of the literature, discussion with experts and participant observation. It also examined the region of South East Queensland, the fastest growing region in Australia, which has specific water limitations and increasing energy demands, both of which are predicted to heighten due to variable climate. The results of the research illustrate the interdependence of systems of water, energy and climate change; moreover, they highlight the fundamental differences between the water and energy sectors and the disconnection that exists in Global, Australian Federal and State governance frameworks in regards to the policy setting associated with these systems. The report demonstrates that the complementary IntegratedWater Resource Management framework can be utilised to form a risk based management approach capable of incorporating the contemporary challenges of the water, energy and climate change nexus. In addition to producing a series of risk based recommendations, this report also provides suggestions for further research in this area.

AB  - In densely populated regions such as Belgium where land is a scarce resource, nature areas are under increasing pressure of urban and infrastructural development. Decisions regarding land use changes usually do not fully account for the associated environmental impacts and the related social welfare changes. This paper aims to provide a generic monetary value function to assess the public benefits of amenity, recreation and biodiversity values associated with land use changes from agricultural land to different types of nature. This function can be used in cost-benefit analyses to inform decisions on land use changes, including the creation, restoration and compensation of nature areas. The ecosystem services values can be compared to the financial costs of such projects and accounted for in policy-making and planning decisions aimed at maximising social welfare. Important criteria for the development of this value function are that: (1) it should be transferable across sites and able to account for relevant characteristics of both the nature areas and the population of beneficiaries, and (2) it should control for spatial variables, such as size of the area and distance to the respondent's home. The value function of our case study is based on a large scale choice experiment, as part of a survey to capture public preferences, focusing on land use changes among a sample of 3000 households in the Flemish region in Belgium. In the choice experiment, respondents were asked to choose between different hypothetical nature development scenarios, described in terms of their ecological quality (nature type, species richness) and a set of spatial characteristics, including, size, accessibility, adjacent land use and distance to the respondents' residence. The model estimates are used to monetise public preferences for land use changes. The results show that the public attributes significantly different values to the different nature types, with highest values for forests. A distance decay effect was clearly observed, meaning that willingness to pay reduces when nature areas are situated further away from the place of residence. The size of the area was also significant but much less significant than would be expected. The application of the value function is demonstrated in two examples. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Transportation congestion is reaching intolerable levels in many urban and suburban areas in the U S. Reliance upon traditional responses, such as transit and new highway capacity, is not working -- especially in suburban areas. Although methods for dealing with suburban congestion are often different, there are a number of common features that must be considered in developing short term as well as more permanent and long lasting solutions. In proposing short term solutions, a "Menu of Actions" is described. It includes transportation actions (the traditional transit and transportation management options) where there are opportunities for getting more out of the existing systems; land use/growth management actions which will result in more rational land use-transportation interactions; financial incentives, to encourage or discourage appropriate actions; more comprehensive and systematic land use and transportation planning; and the organizational and institutional actions required to implement rational solutions. While the "Mann of Actions" provides a broad array of possible actions to provide relief in the short run, over time the growth in traffic is likely to outpace their effectiveness. Consequently, longer term and often more difficult solutions must be considered and implemented as appropriate. They could include changes in land use development and land use management policies; changes in lifestyle and business practices; improvements through technological innovation; changes in the traditional ways of providing transportation services; and greatly expanded research and development.

AB  - This paper presents basic findings obtained by means of a simulation model for representing an evacuation process from a curved bi-directional Italian road tunnel in the event of a fire. Simulations were carried out by using the STEPS people evacuation model associated with a CFD model simulating the fire. It was found that the evacuation time is primarily influenced by the walking time and to a less extent by the pre-movement time in all scenarios studied. The presence of an alarm system reduced the evacuation time for most the tunnel users, allowing them to reach the tunnel exit in safety.

AB  - Virtual Reality training for fire fighters and managers has two main advantages. On one hand, it supports the simulation of complex scenarios like big cities, where a fire cannot be simulated in the real world. On the other hand, fire fighting VR simulators allow trainees to experience situations as similar as possible to real fire, reducing the probability of accidents when they are practising exercises with real fire. The success of the Virtual Reality training tools also depends on how close to reality the simulation process is. This work provides fire spread algorithms for forest and urban environments, which can be used at interactive rates. Due to the interactive nature of the algorithms, the users are able to fight the fire by throwing extinguishing agents. Although the algorithms assume many simplifications of the problem, their behaviour is satisfactory. This is due to the efficient management of the cell states in a 3 m×3 m cell grid. Also the variables that have more influence on fire propagation constitute the core of the algorithms. The overall system deals with user extinguishment actions, natural and artificial firebreaks, variable wind conditions (even at a cell level) and non-contiguous fire propagation (embers and spotting fires). The unified forest/urban model leads to an object oriented architecture which supports the fire propagation algorithms. This also allows the system to compute efficiently mixed forest-urban environments. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is shown that separate sensitivity analysis procedures for a land use model with exogenous travel costs and a transportation network with elastic demand can be combined to get a sensitivity analysis procedure for the integrated model. Sensitivity-analysis-based techniques can then be used for the optimal design of land use plans and transportation policies so that certain social surplus functions are optimized. The proposed method is illustrated with a residential location model with a congestible transportation network sub-model. ?? 2007 China Association for Science and Technology.

This article explores expected sensitivities of the world's managed forests, forest environment and forest sector to future climate change. A variety of studies are summarized. If significant climate changes occur over the next 50-75 years, forests throughout the world will undergo massive adjustments, many of which will in the short term be undesirable. Forest management has high potential for mitigating these effects, but only with support of insightful policy initiatives that take account of potential climatic changes.

AB  - The relationships between land use and biodiversity are fundamental to understanding the links between people and their environment. Biodiversity can be measured in many ways. The concept covers not only the overall richness of species present in a particular area but also the diversity of genotypes, functional groups, communities, habitats and ecosystems there. As a result, the relationships between biodiversity in its broadest sense and land use can be complex and highly context dependent. Moreover, the relationships between them are often two-way, so that simple relationships between cause and effect can be difficult to identify. In some places, specific land uses or land management practices may be important in sustaining particular patterns of biodiversity. Elsewhere, the uses to which land can be put are highly dependent on the biodiversity resources present. The review will consider how changes in the quantity, quality and spatial configuration of different aspects of land use can impact on different components of biodiversity, and what direct and indirect factors might drive these changes. The need to distinguish between land cover and land use will be discussed in relation to the economic and social drivers of land use change. The review will also consider whether framing biodiversity objectives involves society in placing constraints upon the types of land use and management practice that are possible, and will consider such arguments in relation to assessments of the costs of biodiversity loss. It would seem that while considerable progress has been made in mapping out plausible futures for land use and biodiversity at global and regional scales, closer integration of modelling, scenario and field-based monitoring is needed to strengthen the evidence base available to decision makers. Challenges that face us include how we take account of the qualitative changes in land cover, and the impacts of such modifications on biodiversity and ecosystem services.

AB  - Accurate heat release rate measurements provide essential information to defining the fire safety characteristics of products. The size, complexity, and cost of full-scale fire tests make achieving accurate and quantitative results a serious challenge. A detailed uncertainty analysis of a large-scale heat release rate measurement facility is presented as a guide to the process of estimating the uncertainty of similar facilities. Quantitative heat release rate measurements of full-scale fires up to 2.7 MW were conducted using the principle of oxygen consumption calorimetry. Uncertainty estimates were also computed for the heat input measurements from a well-controlled natural gas burner. The measurements of heat input and heat release rate were performed independently, and the discrepancy between the two was well within the uncertainty limits. The propagation of uncertainty was performed at the level of voltage and temperature measurements, which avoided using mutually dependent measurement parameters. Reasons for the significant contribution to the combined uncertainty from the oxygen concentration and exhaust flow measurements are demonstrated. Also presented is a first-order effort to account for the uncertainty due to factors in full-scale fire tests such as operator error and environmental influences that are not modeled by the heat release rate equation.

AB  - This paper gives an overview of the tunnel fire research, both experimental and theoretical work with the exception of computer modelling. The overview shows that the critical velocity for longitudinal flow in a tunnel is the single most well investigated fire phenomenon found in the tunnel fire research literature. This knowledge has reached a high level but there are still some areas that need to be investigated further. For example, very little work has been done on backlayering of smoke upstream a fire and cross-sectional effects on heat release rates, temperatures, flame lengths, fire spread and toxic conditions. Extensive work using model scale tunnels has contributed with new information and clarified many phenomena but the lack of good large scale experimental data is and will be a key issue in near future. This concerns mainly the correlation between heat release rate and maximum ceiling temperatures, the influence of ventilation on maximum heat release rate and fire growth rate and fire spread in and between vehicles. The extensive theoretical work which has been conducted concerning the effects of ventilation on heat release rates needs to be further investigated in large scale tests.

AB  - Neither the 'development' nor the 'underdevelopment' perspective on administrative practice has devoted much attention to investigating the involvement of civil servants in policy formation and implementation, However, any comprehensive assessment of the role of the state administrative apparatus must encompass public policy analysis. The focus in the present article is on policy implementation in the case of the allocation by state governments of statutory land use rights. The author examines the ways in which the bureaucratic bourgeoisie controls the award of statutory land use rights in two northern states of Nigeria (Kano and Bauchi). Policy implementation biases are revealed through analysis of process and beneficiaries. The crucial question is: Who benefits from the policy interpretations that gatekeepers apply in determining access to land use rights and the award of statutory titles? Analysis of both process and beneficiaries supports the conclusion that poor rural and urban residents have been effectively barred from the land allocation system in Kano and Bauchi states.

link geometry, actuator locations, and feedback gains are optimized with
respect to the settling time of the system. First, a two-link, nonrigid
arm is analyzed, and a simple dynamic model representing rapid
positioning processes is obtained. A PD control system is designed for
the dynamic model. Optimal feedback gains minimizing the settling time
are obtained as functions of structural parameters involved in the
dynamic model. The structural parameters are then optimized by using an
optimization technique in order to obtain an overall optimal
performance. The resultant arm design shows an outstanding performance,

Hence, in a general sense, the spread of fire in a building is non-deterministic and the likely pattern of spread can only be predicted within limits of confidence expressed in probabilistic terms. Non-deterministic models are of two types- probabilistic and stochastic. The object of this paper is to explain, with examples, the dis tinguishing features of these two types. In probabilistic models, critical events occurring during fire spread are treated as entirely random and independent. These models deal with the final outcomes, e.g., area damaged, which is sufficient in fire protection and insurance problems not requiring a detailed knowl edge of the underlying physical processes. Probabilistic models discussed include proba bility distributions, logic-probability trees and probabilistic version of a deterministic model. In stochastic models, critical events occurring seauentially in space and time form a chain and are interconnected by transition probabilities.

AB  - Increasing longitudinal ventilation velocity enhances the heat transfer from hot gases to fuel and then results in an increase of the fire growth rate in a tunnel fire. However, the effect of ventilation on the flame spread and the fire growth rate has not been fully explored. In this paper the relationship between the flame spread and the fire growth rate in a ventilated flow was analyzed theoretically. A large amount of data relevant to the fire growth rate from model and large scale tunnel fire tests was collected and applied to a detailed analysis of the effect of ventilation on the fire growth rate. The thermal inertia, heat of combustion, the wet perimeter, and the mass burning rate per unit area of the fuel play important roles in the fire growth rate. In addition, the fire growth rate increases linearly with the ventilation velocity. A correlation that fits all the data of the fire growth rate from model and large scale tunnel fire tests very well was proposed.

AB  - Bioproductive land is one of the most significant natural resources. People use the land for receiving ecological services. This leads to humans using and favouring certain species, while competing with all other species. Land use can create diverse cultural landscapes of outstanding aesthetic, economic and ecological value, but it may equally result in land degradation, soil loss and impoverished ecosystems. Hence land use is shaped by processes of society-nature interaction. These processes can detract from sustainability-in other words, society-nature interaction may deplete the natural capital upon which the provision of ecosystem services for humans depends. Sustainability indicators aim at monitoring key aspects of society-nature interaction in order to generate information needed to document the current state and the history leading up to it. Moreover, they are useful to communicate complex sustainability problems within the scientific community, to policy-makers and the broad public. This paper introduces a special issue that seeks to contribute to the development of sustainability indicators that track society-nature interaction. We focus on a variety of concepts that measure socio-economic metabolism. All the discussed approaches relate socio-economic energy and material flows to the bioproductive area needed to support them, above all, the ecological footprint and the human appropriation of net primary production. In addition, this special issue also analyses the consequences of land use intensity on the diversity, naturalness and patterns of landscapes. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to analysis the performance capabilities of sewing machine operators (SMO) with best fit mathematical models (BFMM) developed. The models are developed on the field data collected during the planned experimentation by using full factorial plan. The values of input variables are changed for generating the actual values of dependent variables. The author in his earlier papers of formulation of experimental models, described in details the independent and dependent variables and the methodology adopted therein. In this paper, the analysis part of various models are discussed for 'Normal", 'Menstruation' and 'Menopause" conditions of female SMO. The total nine, best fit mathematical models (BFMM) are developed and the results are analysed, qualitatively as well as quantitatively and found ultimately complex in nature. But the degree of complexity appears least (4-juctions) in 'Normal' phase. Whereas maximum complexity (5-junctions) appears in 'Menstruation' and 'Menopause" condition. The subject shall be tested for all women factors during study but requires the substantial period which is not tolerable. Therefore SMOs of different ages are selected for covering various women factors. Since the environmental factors are uncontrollable, the effects are justified by planning the experimentation for a complete year, during different seasons. 'Normal' phase is more responsive to performance than other women phases. SIMOs require adjustable stool height convenient to their seating. The work of testing the effect of 'women factors' on the performance capability of sewing operation had been tested and evaluated for the first time and are important parameters to avoid the post ill-effect on health caused due to unhealthy situations at different stages of women workers during their lifetime

AB  - The development of wind energy in France presents an exemplary case of contrast between the policy instrument and its effectiveness in terms of installed wind power capacity. After 7 years of one of the highest feed-in tariffs in the world, the installed capacity in France is still very low. This is notably due to a diffuse pattern of administrative landscape protection which impacts on the construction of wind power potential. In turn, the pace of wind power development can be understood only by looking in more detail at the way in which landscape is dealt with in local planning processes. This paper examines the question using the case of Aveyron in southern France. We follow the shifting ways in which landscape is enrolled in wind power planning, in a context where new planning instruments favor an incipient decentralization in wind power policy. The case points to a change in both the networks and the concepts involved in the design of landscape representations that underlie the construction of wind power potential. We show that this change has been forced by the far-reaching and decentralized visual impacts of wind power technology, suggesting that technology is recomposing the social as part of its development process and questioning the very meaning and perception that is given to landscape. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines the reform of the land administration system (LAS) in China since 1978, and its benefits, shortcomings and options for further reform. The LAS reform has had significant effects on land use and economic development. It has created a more effective land use system and a market for transfers of land, in particular non-agricultural land. Meanwhile, a basic system of land administration has been realized. Important legislative changes accompanied the LAS reform. Imperfect aspects of the LAS, however, result in some negative effects on land allocation such as the rapid loss of arable land to the non-agricultural sectors, very small land use scale and degrading land quality. A framework of further reform measures dealing with these problems is presented in this paper.

AB  - Rapid urban sprawl and population decentralization in recent decades have increased the size of the wildland-urban interface and resulted in higher community risk and vulnerability to wildfire. This paper primarily focuses on understanding grass-fueled fires common to Texas and improving the understanding of the physics and fire dynam- ics that are inherent in the grassland and prairie flame spread problem. Little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) grass was chosen as the grassland fuel due to its prevalent coverage in the Texas area and its relevance to grassland fires in Texas. The methodol- ogy in this study relies on a framework to characterize fuel properties of little bluestem grass using small- and intermediate-scale experiments to better predict full-scale fire behavior. An intermediate-scale numerical flame spread model was developed for grass fuels that accounts for fuel moisture content to calculate the mass versus time of a burn- ing little bluestem plant. The results of the small- and intermediate-scale experiments were used to develop input parameters for a field-scale numerical simulation of a grass field using a physics-based computational fire model, Wildland-urban interface Fire Dynamics Simulator (WFDS). A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the effect of varying WFDS input parameters on the fire spread rate. The results indicate that the fuel moisture content had the most significant impact on the fire spread rate.

AB  - Rural land-use in the European Union (EU) is strongly influenced by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) because it directly affects the relative profitability of different land-use options. Since 2000, the CAP has been heavily reformed. In particular, in Sweden, the 2003 CAP reform was followed by substantial shifts in agricultural land allocation. However, this land-use change has barely been studied empirically beyond the net changes of land-use categories. In order to better understand the transformation of the land-use system, all transitions between land-use categories and changes within existing categories need to be considered. This article presents an analysis of agricultural land-use change between 2002 and 2010 in a landscape in southern Sweden. The inter-category land transitions were identified and quantified by using a spatially explicit field-level resolution dataset. The intra-category change of utilization intensity was assessed for grasslands by using standard yields and forage consumption estimates. Substantial shifts in chains of connected inter-category land transitions were found between cereals, temporary grasses, permanent pastures and fallow lands. The grassland utilization analysis showed a growing gap between grassland area and forage consumption. These results indicate concentration of agricultural production to better quality land and a growing number of land-idling farms in the region. The CAP single farm payment scheme is discussed in the light of these findings. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many nations lack a coherent national approach to land administration. Instead, land information and processes are frequently disaggregated across states, provinces, cantons, counties, or municipalities. This is particularly the case in federated countries. The growing body of land administration theory often assumes or prescribes the need for national systems; however, the justification for this approach requires further explanation. Without justification, nations that maintain disaggregated systems lack the impetus to unlock the opportunities veiled within their disparate land administration systems. Moreover, a nation's ability to respond effectively to emerging national and global-scale issues such as climate-change is greatly impeded. This paper aims to explain the need for national land administration infrastructures. Qualitative case studies of the Australian context and the method of triangulation inform the justification. The research reveals most drivers can be classified into six overarching subsets: adherence to international standards by national governments, better federal or central governance, improved shared governance, scale of economies for lower levels of government, opportunities and savings for business, and social inclusion for citizens. Unfortunately, specific drivers are found to be complex and changeable, as political, scientific and environmental debates raise policy issues: there is no single solution. As an alternative, nations must seize on the specific drivers relevant to their context. They must employ them to transform disparate land administration systems into multi-purpose national land administration infrastructures that deliver benefits to all stakeholder groups. © 2011.

AB  - Agri-environmental indicators are being developed in Canada to assess and report on the environmental sustainability of agricultural production activities. Concerns about water quality have led to the development of an indicator called residual soil nitrogen (RSN), which reflects annual nitrogen left in the soil profile after crops are harvested. The Canadian agricultural nitrogen budget (CANB) is used to integrate this indicator with the economic Canadian regional agriculture model (CRAM) to assess the implications of national and regional agricultural policy scenarios. CANB has built-in scaling-up and scenario-analysis capabilities, so that its outputs can be generated and mapped at the soil landscapes of Canada (scale 1:1 million) level, as well at provincial and national scales. Using census of agriculture data for 1981 and 1996, the CANB model predicted RSN levels across Canada for 2008. The impacts of CRAM policy scenarios in the year 2008, which include changes in crop areas, animal numbers, fertilization and animal feeding practices, each with a low, medium and high level of adoption, are evaluated in terms of changes in RSN compared to a 2008 'business as usual' scenario. National average RSN values are projected to increase from 21.8 kg N/ha in 1981 to 36.5 kg N/ha in the 2008 'business as usual' scenario. Between 1996 and 2008, the proportion of farmland containing greater than 40 kg of excess N/ha increased from 18% to 34% in response to increased fertilizer use, increased manure application and increases in the area of legume crops. Changes in land use practices, such as decreasing the summerfallow area or switching some annual cropland to perennial forages and forestry, appear to have a minimal effect on RSN levels as compared to the 'business as usual' scenario. However, policy scenarios that improve nitrogen fertilization and animal feeding practices were found to significantly decrease RSN levels and thereby reduce the risk of nitrate contamination of the environment. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The first approach considers ways to circumvent the status of rights in land, and looks at their basis in traditional social attitudes and assumptions --factors no longer supported by scientific knowledge and changing concepts of public interest. The second concerns the feasibility of general laws to reflect changing perceptions of rights over land through declarations of national policy. Each approach reveals complexities that pose great difficulties to any effort to achieve a legally defined set of principles for land use that would reinforce a basic stewardship ethic for the land throughout the US.

AB  - This paper explores Swaziland's National Action Programme (NAP) to combat desertification; the country's main strategy for implementing the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). It considers whether this policy tackles real problems supported by micro-level scientific evidence and local experiences, or whether it further reinforces popular orthodoxies about land degradation. Data from one case study chiefdom in Swaziland are used to test two key orthodoxies identified within the country's NAP: (1) the presentation of degradation as a neo-Malthusian problem resulting from population pressure and (2) the assumption that the poor are responsible for degradation of their environment, in particular, the over-use of forest areas and the degradation of soils. It is found that diverse rural livelihoods inherently deliver patches of degradation at the micro-level but it is not necessarily population pressure or poor people that cause the degradation. Households with varying assets simultaneously degrade and conserve different parts of the land resource through pursuing different livelihood activities. The data indicate that while the NAP focuses on mythical problems grounded in the orthodoxies, policy attention is directed away from the more serious land degradation issues affecting rural livelihoods. The findings of this study provide a more nuanced understanding of the gaps between land degradation policy, local conservation practice and environmental and livelihood outcomes, and suggest that policymakers need to evaluate more critically the outdated and simplistic degradation orthodoxies on which much current policy is based. Stronger links need to be made between scientific and policymaking communities, while more credence should be given to land users' own knowledges, perspectives, concepts and categories surrounding issues of soil conservation and degradation. It is suggested that steps need to be taken towards the development of broadly applicable benchmarks and indicators that bring together local and scientific knowledges across levels. Without this, popularised orthodoxies will continue to provide a basis for inappropriate land policy. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract Land and water resource issues typically fall under separate governance systems. For example, agricultural policy regulates land-cover change while water departments regulate water quality. However, land-use changes can directly affect water resources. Water flow regulation is a key service which is affected by changes in land-cover but its dynamics are poorly understood by most policy makers and land management organisations. We simulated and quantified the effects of plant invasions on land-cover, hydrological soil characteristics and catchment responsiveness on flow regulation using a hydrological model. The case study was located in the indigenous fynbos shrublands in South Africa. Fynbos requires fire to regenerate, has moderate biomass, occurs mostly in areas with a potential to erode and is prone to invasion by woody plant species, particularly trees. Invasions can affect flow regulation by changing community structure and function and increasing fuel loads. The greater fuel load increases fire intensity and severity which, in turn, changes the hydrological responses of catchments. Few studies have assessed the effects of invasion on hydrological responses but studies on plantations have recorded significant increases in soil water repellence following fire, resulting in increased overland flow similar to impacts of fires in invaded areas. Simulation of clear-felling of pines and different degrees of water repellency increased both the responsiveness of the catchment to rainfall and extreme rainfall events. The simulated fire effects were consistent with other studies of hydrological responses to fire. Our study indicates that invasions of pines and acacias in the study area could substantially increase the risk of flood damage even from moderate rainfall events, and highlights the importance of maintaining flow regulation capacity. New policy approaches are required which take account of the linkages and interactions between land-use choices, water resources and ecosystem services, and address them when considering governance arrangements.

AB  - Fire residues of three different accidental fires in private residences were investigated for PBDD/F and brominated flame retardants. In most samples brominated substances could be detected, especially PBDPE, in a concentration range from 1 to 100 mg/kg. One sample, a plastic-TV-case, however, contained 5 % PBDPE. The concentrations of PBDD/F were in the range from 1 to 173 ??g/kg with the exception of another TV-case, which contained 14,910 ??g/kg PBDD/F. That TV-case which was probably equipped with brominated flame retardants represented a source for PBDDIF-contamination of other objects in the room. During this investigation we found that brominated dioxins and furans were generated by defined sources containing precursor substances, and were then transported to other objects of different surface structures. Objects far away from the source of PBDD/F and with a smooth surface contained less PBDD/F than those near to the source or with a raw and well adsorbing surface.

A literature review and a survey of 25 states and three metropolitan planning organizations identified 41 such measures.  No single measure best quantifies  effective coordination because this coordination supports potentially conflicting goals, such as better access management and\nincreased local autonomy.  Further, when measures are computed under four benevolent scenarios that each generate the support of some stakeholders (reduced transit costs, reduced congestion, increased local autonomy, and increased compact development) some performance  measures indicate improvement and others do not.

AB  - Structural Virology is today an all-important scientific discipline that permeates most other virological disciplines. The application of physical and physicochemical techniques has led to the determination of the high-resolution molecular structures of many viruses. The interplay of this approach with biochemical and biological approaches has allowed the elucidation of the structural basis of viral function in unprecedented detail. In addition, in the last years theoretical and experimental physicists have begun to tackle a fundamental physics-based approach to study different aspects of the architecture, self-assembly and material properties of virus particles. A new term, Physical Virology, has recently been coined to encompass these and related studies. This approach is beginning to merge with long-standing structural virology approaches to provide a renewed and richer view on viruses, as well as further advances in the fight against viral disease and the applications of viruses in biotechnology and nanotechnology. Structure and Physics of Viruses is an interdisciplinary textbook in which the rapidly expanding fields of structural and physical virology are dealt with in an integrated way. The authors have attempted to write a book basic enough to be useful to students, as well as advanced and current enough to be useful to senior scientists. This book is aimed first at M.Sc. students, Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers with a university degree in biology, chemistry, physics or related sciences who share an interest or are actually working on viruses. It is aimed also at providing an updated account of many important concepts, techniques, studies and applications in structural and physical virology for established scientists working on viruses, irrespective of their physical, chemical or biological background and their field of expertise.

AB  -  To combine the high packing density and high impedance of the MOSFETs and the high driving, surge protective capability of the bipolar transistor, it is most desirable to fabricate both devices in a monolithic structure called the MOS-BI structure. Various structures will be discussed involving different combinations of: enhancement or depletion mode MOSFETs, vertical npn or pnp bipolar transistors and vertical or lateral bipolar transistors. MOSBI structure can be most readily achieved with enhancement mode p-channel MOSFETs and n-p-n bipolar transistor. The p-type diffusion for forming the base of the n-p-n transistor is used also for forming the source and the drain of the MOSFET. The n-type epitaxial background resistivity is in the 2 to 5 &amp;#937;-cm range on p-type substrate of

AB  - This study explores land use conflict in S.E. Kajiado District, Kenya. The conflict reflects ongoing competition over access to scarce land and water resources between herding, farming and wildlife, that has been conspicuous for over 30 years and is intensifying. While the complexity of the dynamic interactions and land use conflicts can be described, and significant driving forces identified, future outcomes are uncertain. The existing land use pattern represents the contemporary imprint of these interactions and it sets the basis for the future. Understanding the conditions that have created the present should, therefore, assist in devising future development strategies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Field experiments were carried out in stands of gorse (Ulex europaeus L.) in New Zealand to determine the conditions under which fires would both ignite and spread. Research and operational experience in shrub fuels suggest that there is a clear difference between conditions that support ignition only (fuel ignites but does not spread beyond a single bush or clump) and conditions that are conducive to fire spread (fuel ignites and develops into a spreading fire). It is important for fire management agencies to be equipped with knowledge of these thresholds, because the different conditions require different levels of preparedness and response. Results indicate that the major variable influencing both fire ignition and fire spread development in gorse is the moisture content of the elevated dead fine fuel layer. Fires were observed to spread successfully in this elevated fuel layer only, independently of the surface fuels and the near-surface fuels. Elevated dead fuels failed to ignite at a moisture content of greater than 36%, and ignition only resulted in a spreading fire at moisture contents below 19%. The results correlate well with field observations and fire practitionersâ€™ experience in these fuels, and provide reliable guidelines for fire management planning.

AB  - Humans have been changing the natural fire regimes in most Brazilian vegetation types for over 4000 years. Natural lightning fires can easily happen in savannas and grasslands, but they are rare in the moist rainforests. Today, anthropogenic fires are frequent in both the fire-adapted cerrado (Brazilian savanna) and the fire-sensitive rainforest. In this paper, I compare two very different biomes concerning their susceptibilities and responses to fire: the Amazon rainforest and the cerrado. I present an overview of their fire history, espe- cially regarding human-made fires for land management, and pull together information about the use of fire by indigenous peoples in the cerrado and the Amazon, as this informa- tion is very fragmented. Accordingly, I describe how fire regimes have changed in these biomes over time due to agricultural practices and the consequences of the current altered fire regimes. After European settlement, fire frequency greatly increased in the cerrado, especially related to cattle ranching, and more recently in the more seasonal landscapes in the Amazon. In cerrado natural preserves, however, managers try to keep fire away, but wildfires eventually come and develop into destructive events. Actions to reduce biodiver- sity loss and environmental deterioration due to inappropriate fire management are neces- sary and should be very distinct in both areas: in the Amazon they would include the devel- opment of policies to stimulate fire-free, small-scale agricultural projects, and in the cerra- do, sustainable use of fire for cattle ranching is possible but the regimes must be fitted to local specific features in order to avoid land degradation. In cerrado conservation areas, proper fire management programs based on scientific knowledge and the incorporation of the traditional expertise of indigenous peoples are needed to maintain the biological diver- sity, to maintain the ecological processes, and to reduce wildfires.

AB  - A computational model for fire spread in a densely built urban area is developed. The model is distinct from existing models in that it explicitly describes fire spread phenomena with physics-based knowledge achieved in the field of fire safety engineering. In the model, urban fire is interpreted as an ensemble of multiple building fires; that is, the fire spread is simulated by predicting behaviors of individual building fires under the thermal influence of neighboring building fires. Adopted numerical technique for the prediction of individual building fire behavior is based on the one-layer zone model. Governing equations of mass, energy, and chemical species in component rooms are solved simultaneously, for the development of temperature, concentrations of chemical species, and other properties. As for the building-to-building fire spread, three mechanisms are considered as contributing factors of fire spread, i.e., (I) thermal radiation from fire-involved buildings; (II) temperature rise due to wind-blown fire plumes; and (III) firebrand spotting. As for the model verification, fire spread simulations were carried out in a hypothetical urban area, where 2500 buildings of identical configuration were aligned at constant separations. Calculated fire spread rates were then compared with that of the Hamada model, and reasonable agreements were obtained. The model was further verified with the record of a past urban fire, which took place in the city of Sakata in 1976. Although the general features of the fire spread were similar, there were certain discrepancies in the eventual burnt area. The reasons for these discrepancies were discussed and issues for future refinements were stated. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In The Accidental Sales Manager, Chris Lytle aims to help sales managers get out of the “sales management trap,” and become more effective at their jobs. Selling and sales management are two different jobs, and require two different mental approaches. The transition from the former to the latter can be difficult. Some never make a meaningful transition because the characteristics that make someone great in sales do not necessarily apply to what makes someone a great sales manager. A seasoned salesperson, sales manager, and professional seminar speaker, Lytle seeks to describe how sales managers can take control of their careers, lead their sales teams to increased productivity, and generate record profits.

AB  - Abstract Objectives : To evaluate integrated care for diabetes in clinical, psychosocial, and economic terms. Design : Pragmatic randomised trial. Setting : Hospital diabetic clinic and three general practice groups in Grampian. Patients : 274 adult diabetic patients attending a hospital clinic and registered with one of three general practices. Intervention - Random allocation to conventional hospital clinic care or integrated care. Integrated care patients seen in general practice every three or four months and in the hospital clinic annually. General practitioners were given written guidelines for integrated care. Main outcome measures : Metabolic control, psychosocial status, knowledge of diabetes, beliefs about control of diabetes, satisfaction with treatment, disruption of normal activities, numbers of consultations and admissions, frequency of metabolic monitoring, costs to patients and NHS. Results - A higher proportion of patients defaulted from conventional care (14 (10%)) than from integrated care (4 (3%), 95% confidence interval of difference 2% to 13%). After two years no significant differences were found between the groups in metabolic control, psychosocial status, knowledge, beliefs about control, satisfaction with treatment, unscheduled admissions, or disruption of normal activities. Integrated care was as effective for insulin dependent as non-insulin dependent patients. Patients in integrated care had more visits and higher frequencies of examination. Costs to patients were lower in integrated care (mean pounds sterling 1.70) than in conventional care (pounds sterling 8). 88% of patients who experienced integrated care wished to continue with it. Conclusions : This model of integrated care for diabetes was at least as effective as conventional hospital clinic care. Practice implications Practice implications Diabetes mellitus affects 1-2% of the population in Britain Life long surveillance is necessary to prevent and detect the long term complications In this study integrated care coordinated by a computer system was as effective at maintaining metabolic control as hospital clinics The complication screening programme was delivered more effectively in integrated care Integrated care may help improve management of diabetes since it was popular with patients and had a lower default rate than hospital based care

AB  - Each family has its secrets, ones that shape family communication and relationships in a way generally unknown to the outsider and often the family itself. Autoethnographers, students of these relationships, confront many silences in their attempts to understand these social worlds. It is often the accidental slip, the spontaneous discussion, the offhanded comment that opens this terrain of secrets to the conscientious storyteller. Accidental Ethnography delves into this shadowy world of pain and loss in the hopes of finding productive, ethical avenues for transforming the secret lives of families into powerful narratives of hope. It merges autoethnographic method with the therapeutic power of storytelling to heal family wounds. Poulos's lyrical text will appeal to those in ethnography, interpersonal communication, and family relationships alike.

AB  - The burning behavior for non-charring fuels is modeled to predict the fire behavior in a compartment. This modeling considers the following phenomena: (i) the reduction of heat transfer from flame due to lack of oxygen mass fraction; and (ii) the thermal feedback from smoke layer and walls. In addition, a compartment integrated zone model is developed to obtain the parameters which are necessary for the prediction of fuel burning behavior. Namely, this approach applies a two-zone model for the growth or pre-flashover stage and a one-zone model for the fully developed or post-flashover stage which also incorporates the fuel burning behavior. Fire experiments in a cubic compartment are conducted to validate this model. Overall, calculations of this integrated compartment model give good agreement with the experiments of mass loss rate and temperature in the compartment.

AB  - A comprehensive study of static transportation network optimization\nproblems with stochastic user equilibrium constraints is presented. It\nis explicitly demonstrated that the formulation of the fixed-point\nproblem - in terms of link flows for the general stochastic user\nequilibrium problem in which the Jacobian matrix of link travel cost\nfunctions may not be symmetric-possesses a unique solution with mild\nconditions. By developing a sensitivity analysis method for the\nstochastic user equilibrium problem, the study proves that the perturbed\nequilibrium link flows are continuously differentiable implicit\nfunctions with respect to perturbation parameters. Accordingly, it can\nbe concluded that the proposed unified bilevel programming model, which\ncan characterize transportation network optimization problems subject to\nstochastic user equilibrium constraints, is a smooth optimization\nproblem. In addition, the study presents a single-level continuously\ndifferentiable optimization formulation that is equivalent to the\nunified bilevel programming model. Furthermore, as a unified solution\nmethod, a successive quadratic programming algorithm based on the\nsensitivity analysis method is used to solve the transportation network\noptimization problems with stochastic user equilibrium constraints.\nFinally, two examples are used to demonstrate the proposed models and\nalgorithm.

AB  - Scaling has been identified as a particularly important element of the Severe Accident Research Program because of its relevance not only to experimentation, but also to analyses based on code calculations or special models. Recognizing the central importance of severe accident scaling issues, the United States Regulatory Commission implemented a Severe Accident Scaling Methodology (SASM) development program involving a lead laboratory contractor and a Technical Program Group to guide the development and to demonstrate its practicality via a challenging application. The Technical Program Group recognized that the Severe Accident Scaling Methodology was an integral part of a larger structure for technical issue resolution and, therefore, found the need to define and document this larger structure, the Integrated Structure for Technical Issue Resolution (ISTIR). The larger part of the efforts have been devoted to the development and demonstration of the Severe Accident Scaling Methodology, which is Component II of the ISTIR. The ISTIR and the SASM have been tested and demonstrated, by their application to a postulated direct containment heating scenario. The ISTIR objectives and process are summarized in this paper, as is its demonstration associated directly with the SASM. The objectives, processes and demonstration for the SASM are also summarized in the paper. The full body of work is referenced.

AB  - A model of major fire spread in a tunnel is described. It employs the concepts of non-linear dynamical systems theory and identifies the onset of instability with major fire spread in a tunnel. In particular, the model associates the existence of a fold bifurcation with dramatic fire spread from an initial fire to a ‘target object’. The purpose is to identify the thermo-physical and geometrical conditions which lead to instability and sudden fire spread. Flame impingement on the target object is assumed not to exist; fire spread is assumed to be by spontaneous ignition only. The case considered assumes the existence of a longitudinal forced ventilation and predicts the critical heat release rate needed for a fire to spread from an initial fire to an item with a given assumed shape. The target object may be taken to approximate a vehicle. The illustrative case approximating fire spread from an initial fire to a heavy goods vehicle (HGV) within the Channel Tunnel is presented; it is not restricted to this case, however. The model is identified with the name FIRE-SPRINT A3, which is an acronym of Fire Spread in Tunnels, Model A, Version 3 . It is a development of an earlier model, FIRE-SPRINT A2. The current model takes greater account of thermal radiation than was done in the earlier work and also assumes a more extensive flame volume for a downstream flame section.

AB  - With growing awareness of fire hazard as an environmental threat within tropical rainforests, the state of Brazil initiated a set of fire control policies aimed at monitoring and ameliorating fire hazard in the Amazon region. These policies were developed in the aftermath of large-scale fire events and reflect a conservationist discourse that responded to internal as well as international environmental concerns. In doing so, the policies have framed the "fire problem" around those who use fire in their land use practices, in particular small-scale agriculturalists. Yet, land policy in general has repeatedly failed to address the institutional arrangements which compel small-scale farmers to use fire in their agricultural practices and the underlying development processes that have made the landscape more vulnerable to accidental spread of fire. Using regional level data on small-scale farmers, I suggest that the conservation oriented approach of fire policy may not be enough to curtail accidental fire events and instead that the fire issue needs to be positioned within rural development as well.

In doing so, the policies have framed the "fire problem" around those who use fire in their land use practices, in particular small-scale agriculturalists. Yet, land policy in general has repeatedly failed to address the institutional arrangements which compel small-scale farmers to use fire in their agricultural practices and the underlying development processes that have made the landscape more vulnerable to accidental spread of fire. Using regional level data on small-scale farmers, I suggest that the conservation oriented approach of fire policy may not be enough to curtail accidental fire events and instead that the fire issue needs to be positioned within rural development as well.

AB  - The precision of forest fire spread prediction heavily depends on the quality of provided input parameters. Unfortunately, fire spread simulators often work with a static set of parameter values not considering dynamic changes over time. Fewest tools offer abilities for real-time data assimilation of modified input parameters during a running prediction. Although making use of external assimilation frameworks, there exists a series of highly dynamic parameters, whose exact measurements are difficult, if not impossible, to obtain in appropriate intervals due to distant meteorological stations and missing sensors. To produce nonetheless reliable spread predictions, fire simulators can rely on input parameter optimisation methods. So far, standard nonlinear function optimisation techniques and evolutionary optimisation methods showed promising potential. But they either are not fully capable of handling high dimensionality and irregularities contained in fire prediction models or present shortcomings when applied to real-time predictions due to time-consuming evaluation functions. However, to avoid tragedy, fire predictions have to satisfy hard real-time constraints. Especially small fire control centres with limited computing resources therefore require fast and efficient calibration methods to keep the additional computational burden to a practicable minimum and deliver the most precise predictions in time. For these reasons, we propose a fast and simulator independent parameter calibration approach based on the analysis of problem-specific knowledge. The method requires the prediction system to provide information about the true state of fire front in reasonable time intervals. Our objective is to discover a simulator input, that best describes current environmental conditions and which is then used to describe best the immediate future. We set up a knowledge base (KB) containing information about historical real fires and synthetical simulated fires where input parameter values are stored together with their corresponding fire simulator output parameters. Before each prediction step, current fire spread behaviour is obtained from the latest real fire map. This information is used to query the KB. A k- Nearest Neighbour classifier searches the group of input parameter values from forest fires that performed the most similar compared to the ongoing event. The returned values are used for a rapid input parameter calibration representing the current fire's causing dynamic conditions. We were able to obtain prediction results with similar quality compared to advanced evolutionary calibration approaches but with significant runtime savings. Thus, our technique enables parameter adjustments in case of large-scale disasters, high-resolution prediction maps or when only limited parallel computing resources are available.

AB  - A phylogeographic survey was used to elucidate the relative roles of historical processes and contemporary gene flow in structuring the genetic pattern observed with Mogurnda adspersa. This species of freshwater fish is found in the rivers and streams of the northeastern highlands of Queensland, Australia. Specifically, this project focused on populations in the Tully and Herbert Rivers in the Atherton Tablelands. Sequence analysis indicated that three distinct clades exist in the headwaters of the Tully River. The population sampled from one of the Tully River streams (Cheetah Creek) contained haplotypes that displayed approximately 3.4% sequence divergence from other haplotypes detected in this river. Furthermore, these haplotypes formed part of the clade which exists throughout not only the Herbert River but other surrounding drainages in the area. These results support the hypothesis that the current genetic structure is strongly affected by changes in drainage patterns due to geomorphological processes that occurred in the recent past.

AB  - Prescribed burn regimes for protected areas in southern Africa are often based solely on modeling of historic data and onsite experimentation. Most rural communities in this region continue to rely on fire to manage natural resources for subsistence needs, yet relatively few detailed studies of local fire knowledge and practices exist. The long history of anthropogenic fire in southern Africa suggests that traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of fire could provide further insight into location-specific anthropogenic contributions to fire-savanna interactions. This study used an ethnographic approach to investigate how local people think about and manage fire as part of their daily activities in two rural communities in southern Mozambique. Residents use fire for a range of livelihood activities and identify both controlled and uncontrolled anthropogenic fire sources. Fire regimes are presented for five common livelihood activities including frequency, seasonality, area, and type of habitat burned. Comparisons between historic and contemporary fires revealed decreases in the number of controlled burns and consequent increases in the size and number of wildfires, but no changes in the purposes for conducting controlled burns or the methods people used to conduct burns. Community fire regulations aim to reduce personal and communal property destruction, as well as protect locally valuable biodiversity. The results highlight the importance in accessing indigenous fire TEK for understanding anthropogenic contributions to fire regimes. Furthermore, they demonstrate that despite different worldviews, indigenous and western fire experts share a common goal in maintaining regional biodiversity.

This chapter discusses current knowledge of the frequency, severity, causes, and impacts of fire in montane cloud forests worldwide as reflected in paleoecological records, recent field studies, and satellite image analyses.   Synthesis of the literature suggests that both human activities and climatic fluctuations have played important and often interlinked roles in determining historical fire regimes in montane cloud forests. In particular, increasing human populations and land use pressures surrounding cloud forest ecosystems, combined with more rapid climate warming this century due to anthropogenic forcing, is apparently leading to dramatic intensification of fire regimes in montane cloud forest regions. These changes may be accompanied by the transformation of cloud forests to more fire-dependent plant communities (comprising species from adjacent ecosystems with more frequent fire) that no longer have sufficient resilience to recover from fire and re-establish the original cloud forest vegetation.  Management efforts need to focus on preventing fires ignited by people for land use purposes from spreading into adjacent cloud forest areas, as well as actively involving local people and communities in fire management and suppression efforts.

AB  - The Rothermel surface fire spread model includes a wind speed limit, above which predicted rate of spread is constant. Complete derivation of the wind limit as a function of reaction intensity is given, along with an alternate result based on a changed assumption. Evidence indicates that both the original and the revised wind limits are too restrictive. Wind limit is based in part on data collected on the 7 February 1967 Tasmanian grassland fires. A reanalysis of the data indicates that these fires might not have been spreading in fully cured continuous grasslands, as assumed. In addition, more recent grassfire data do not support the wind speed limit. The authors recommend that, in place of the current wind limit, rate of spread be limited to effective midflame wind speed. The Rothermel model is the foundation of many wildland fire modelling systems. Imposition of the wind limit can significantly affect results and potentially influence fire and fuel management decisions.

AB  - This paper describes a series of tests carried out with a comprehensive transportation, land use and air quality simulation system, which has been designed for planning application at the metropolitan or regional scale, within the framework of the U.S. Government's Clean Air legislation. The urban location portion of the system was developed at the University of Pennsylvania under the direction of S. H. Putman. The air quality sections incorporate models formulated in earlier studies. The system was tested with data from the San Francisco Bay area, for the period 1975–1980. The test policies included changes in regional transportation costs and population totals; local interventions in the transportation network; and controls on pollutant emissions from mobile and stationary sources. To assess net impacts, the outcomes predicted for each policy were compared with the outcomes predicted in a “benchmark”, or base run of the system. The tests showed that the system is sensitive to a broad range of air quality policies, and that it is capable of predicting important air quality consequences of transportation and land use policies. Some further development will be needed before the system can be used in practical planning situations, but there is little doubt as to the soundness of its central theoretical constructs and logical structure.

AB  - Human use of the land and oceans is at the center of some of the most complicated and pressing problems faced by policy makers\n  around the world today (e.g., DeFries et al. 2004b; Platt 2004; Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). For the terrestrial\n  biosphere, our need to balance current human needs and longer-term environmental sustainability often involves consideration\n  of the way we use ecosystem goods and services produced by the land. Land-use is at the center of these trade-offs because\n  changes in land use often enhance the share of energy, water and nutrients devoted to human needs but decrease the share available\n  for other species and ecosystem functions. Problems as far ranging as improving human health or ensuring adequate food production\n  cannot be solved unless policy makers understand how their policies alter land use and how altered land use affects ecosystem\n  functions. For example, public health policy that adequately accounts for the future spread of mosquitoes that carry Plasmodium\n  or malaria in the tropics often requires an understanding of the interplay between land use and climate (Lines 1995) (see\n  Chap. 4). In China, agricultural policy makers are using a recent assessment of cropland area to create policies that ensure\n  there will be enough land to meet China’s rapidly growing demand for food, feedgrains, and raw materials that is driven by\n  rapid economic growth (Welch and Pannell 1982; Yang and Li 2000; Ho and Lin 2004; Lin and Ho 2005), although it is not clear\n  that other ecosystem services will be maintained in this process.

AB  - This is a review of the essential ingredients needed to make a mathematical model of fire spread through a fuel bed. The physical problem is outlined in general terms. Previous models are classified as statistical, empirical, or physical in accordance with the methods used in their construction. Considerable attention is given to the many physical models proposed over the fifty years of model building. A unified mathematical treatment is presented, which permits a more objective comparison of the different physical models. The key theoretical and experimental expositions in the literature are interpreted as pointing to a missing ingredient for fire spread in still air: a short range heat transfer mechanism. A candidate for this is buoyant convection, which unfortunately is very difficult to model in terms of the fundamental fluid dynamic equations. However, the concept of turbulent transport by eddies can be of help here, resulting in flame spread rates which depend on values for the eddy diffusivity of the fuel bed.

AB  - Experiments have shown that pressure vessels made of ASME SA 455 steel can fail by high-temperature stress rupture in less than 100 min when exposed to accidental fire heat loads. The objective of this work is to develop a three dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) model capable of predicting structural failure in pressure vessels to assess the effects that various parameters have on vessel failure. These parameters included wall thickness, vessel dimensions, wall temperature and vessel internal pressure. Also, the effect of local hot spots on failure time was investigated. The finite element analyses were conducted on 500, 1000 and 33,000 US gallon pressure vessels using ABAQUS. From the results of the three dimensional finite element analyses it was found that shorter and/or thicker walled (with respect to vessel diameter) pressure vessels have greater fire survivability then longer and/or thinner walled pressure vessels. It was also found that if peak wall temperature and internal pressure were the same, pressure vessels exposed to fully engulfing fires would fail sooner than pressure vessels exposed to a local fire impingement. Also, it was shown that the MPC Omega method could be used to predict fast stress ruptures. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Land cover change in the Neotropics represents one of the major drivers of global environmental change. Several models have been proposed to explore future trajectories of land use and cover change, particularly in the Amazon. Despite the remarkable development of these tools, model results are still surrounded by uncertainties. None of the model projections available in the literature plausibly captured the overall trajectory of land use and cover change that has been observed in the Amazon over the last decade. In this context, this study aims to review and analyze the general structure of the land use models that have most recently been used to explore land use change in the Amazon, seeking to investigate methodological factors that could explain the divergence between the observed and projected rates, paying special attention to the land demand calculations. Based on this review, the primary limitations inherent to this type of model and the extent to which these limitations can affect the consistency of the projections will also be analyzed. Finally, we discuss potential drivers that could have influenced the recent dynamic of the land use system in the Amazon and produced the unforeseen land cover change trajectory observed in this period. In a complementary way, the primary challenges of the new generation of land use models for the Amazon are synthesized. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The urgency of the environmental debate has renewed the interest in the application of integrated models of urban land use and transportation. In the United States new legislation inspired by growing environmental awareness such as the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 requires that transportation planning must consider the interaction between transportation and land use in a consistent fashion – as it can be done only by land-use transportation models. However, this new interest in land use models also presents new challenges to the land use modelling community. A new generation of activity-based travel models and new neighborhoodscale transportation planning policies require more detailed information on household demographics and employment characteristics and the location of activities. Moreover, the models need to be able to predict not only economic but also environmental impacts of land-use transportation policies. Today there exist several operational urban land-use transportation models which have the potential to respond to these challenges. At the same time there exist exciting opportunities to incorporate new theoretical developments and methodologies into the field. The paper reviews the current state of the art of operational land-use transportation models using criteria such as comprehensiveness, overall structure, theoretical foundations, modeling techniques, dynamics, data requirements, calibration and validation, operationality and applicability and evaluates their suitability with respect to the new requirements and speculates about the most promising avenues to further improvement and diffusion of this kind of model.

AB  - China's economic reforms over the past decades have given rise to the development of a rudimentary urban land market. Although one cannot speak of a land "market" in the strict sense of the word, there is an urban land allocation system in which land lease rights can be acquired through the payment of a land-use fee. If the urban land market is to develop in a sustainable manner, new credible institutions need to be established that can safeguard greater legal security and transparency. For these purposes, it is necessary to establish a management system that can support the legal (tenure security), economic (leases, taxes) and broader aspects (spatial and environmental land use policies) of land administration. To make an urban land administration system socially credible and functional, land-related information should be registered and structured at a detailed spatial level, such as parcels. There is no parcel-based information system in China, but the country has developed a population registration system at a detailed spatial level that could be a starting point to develop integrated information systems, or a so-called "local spatial data infrastructure". This paper reviews China's population registration system and their spatial units and presents a proposal for an information system that can be expanded or adapted to meet the requirements of an effective land administration system. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper we present a framework for understanding regional land use processes by incorporating the concept of agglomeration economies into agricultural frontier theory. We show that agricultural firms can obtain positive externalities from locating in close proximity to other agricultural firms, leading to agglomeration economies. Agglomeration economies lead to high levels of competition and diversity within a local agricultural supply chain and influence local prices, information flows, and private enforcement of environmental institutions. We use the theory of agglomeration economies to understand the development of soybean production in two counties along the Santar??m-Cuiaba (BR-163) highway in the Brazilian Amazon: Santar??m, Par?? and Sorriso, Mato Grosso. We conclude that differences in environmental and land tenure institutions influenced the occurrence of agglomeration economies in these two counties, which in turn affected the total factor productivity of soy in each region. In particular, the supply chain became extremely competitive and diverse in Sorriso where few environmental regulations existed, while environmental restrictions reduced the diversification of the supply chain in Santar??m. The presence of a soy agglomeration economy in Sorriso spurred innovation, increased productivity, and led to extremely rapid soy expansion in that county, while the monopolistic supply chain in Santar??m reduced producers' access to land and capital and impeded soy expansion. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The results showed: (1) an acid treatment could effectively disassemble collagen fibrils; (2) in the resulting porous composites, beta-TCP particles homogenously existed on the skeleton of the collagen fibril network and bonded tightly to both the fibrils and themselves. The tight bonding formation could be due to the reaction between Ca ions in the particles and carboxyl groups in collagen polypeptide chains and due to the reprecipitation of partially dissolved beta-TCP during synthesis. The tight bonding between beta-TCP particles and collagen fibrils in the composites demonstrated an integrated structure, which was reproducible when beta-TCP/collagen ratio ranged from 2 to 4. Such integrated structure would make significant contributions in reliably tailoring properties of the porous composites by varying beta-TCP content. In addition, the porous composites had large porosity (approximately 95%) and appropriate pore size (approximately 100 microm), showed no negative impact in cytotoxicity assay and complete bone tissue regeneration after 12 weeks in animal test.

AB  - Although urban conflagrations are rare now, the threat still exists in two situations - following an earthquake and when a wildland fire reaches an urban area. In this paper, we first extend a previously developed urban fire simulation model to include fire department suppression, making it a complete, integrated ignition-spread-suppression model that can now better estimate urban fire risk and help understand the effectiveness of fire department efforts. We then apply this Urban Fire Simulation model (UFS2) to a case study area in California and conduct a parametric study to examine the key factors that influence fire spread and the interactions among them. The results suggest that urban fire spread is highly variable and under the right combination of unlucky but possible circumstances - many ignitions, high wind speeds, and limited water availability - the losses can be very high, much higher than observed in recent earthquakes. In addition to the three factors mentioned, the locations of the ignitions (relative to wind direction and fire breaks), number of engines, and engine arrival times are shown to be important. Strong interactions are evident between wind speed and number of ignitions, and between water availability and number of engines. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Prescribed burning in chaparral, currently used to manage wildland fuels and reduce wildfire hazard, is often conducted under marginal burning conditions. The relative importance of the fuel and environmental variables that determine fire spread success in chaparral fuels is not quantitatively understood. Based on extensive experimental study, a two-dimensional numerical model for vegetation fire spread was developed to simulate laboratory-scale fires. This model is based on a detailed description of the complex heat transfer processes and a simple combustion mechanism contributing to the ignition of solid fuel and fire spread. The fuel bed is described as a porous medium, and the heterogeneous nature of foliage and branch is considered via specific physical properties such as surface area-to-volume ratio, density, and volume fraction. The burning of solid fuel is computed by solving mass and energy equations, including the effects of drying, pyrolysis, and char combustion and the exchanges of mass, momentum, and energy with the surrounding gas. The effects of wind, slope, fuel moisture content, fuel bed arrangement, environmental temperature, and humidity are considered in the numerical model. Computations were performed to compare successful and unsuccessful fire spread cases to highlight the effects of various factors. Numerical results were consistent with the experimental observations of the transition between no fire spread and spread under different fuel and environmental conditions. The simulated heat transfer processes and combustion mechanism in the fuel bed are helpful in identifying factors that determine fire spread success. It was found that the relative importance of modeled convective and radiative heat transfer processes to ignition of solid fuel differed with particle location, and could be switched depending on the wind speed, terrain slope, and fuel bed arrangement. ?? 2005 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - Based upon land use surveys undertaken in Macau during 1994, this paper updates changes in land use between 1972 and 1983 analysed in a previous issue of Land Use Policy. Many of the trends seen in past land use in the territory have continued but further intensification and modernization has led to the increase in use of underground areas and a more modern type of mixed residential/commercial use than the previous dominant Chinese 'bazaar' type of commercial use with upstairs residences. Finally plans show that by 2005 there is likely to be another massive expansion of reclaimed land with the island of Taipa becoming completely urbanized.

AB  - Land tenure and resource availability can play a critical role in the land use decision-making process, resulting in different types of land use changes. This paper investigates the role of land tenure security and farm household characteristics on land use change in the Prasae Watershed, Thailand, using GIS and farm-level data. Forest conversion to annual crops and subsequently to perennial crops was a typical land use change during 1982-2004. Tenure insecurity is found to be associated with deforestation and forest encroachment. Insecure landholders adopt perennial crops in order to acquire basic land use rights and entitlement to subsequent legal registration, while more secure land tenure is seen to have economic advantages for production and long-term investment. Although land tenure security can act as a crucial factor in land use decision making, farmers opt for different land use options based on characteristics such as farm size and available labor. To advance the economic well-being of insecure and temporary landholders and support forest conservation, this report concludes that an effective policy should aim to improve both farm productivity and land quality while protecting the remaining forest. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urban containment strategies are one of the best-known planning instruments for managing urban sprawl. The two main types of such strategies are greenbelts and urban growth boundaries. The boundaries set by the Land Use Plan in Switzerland have been applied since 1970. We evaluate the effect and success of this strategy by analysing expansion of developed land, change in number of buildings, and building density within and outside building zones in four Swiss municipalities 1970-2000. Our results show that the boundary restricted most development to building zones and promoted increased building density. Generally, building density increased in the building zones but decreased outside of building zones. For more efficiency and success, the political institutions should specify explicit goals for development inside and outside of building zones, and develop new instruments for guiding development outside of building zones. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) increasingly receives attention\nfrom executives, business academics, and public officials. However,\nwhether CSR positively contributes to firm performance is inconclusive.\nThis paper integrates and extends the extant literature about CSR and\nintroduces a conceptual framework and propositions on how firms can\naccomplish some social goals effectively and still, meet the performance\nexpectations of shareholders. This paper suggests five major CSR-related\nstrategies including the integration of CSR activities into business\noperations, CSR-related innovations and first-mover advantage,\nCSR-related advertising and risk management, relationships with\nCSR-related governmental and nongovernmental organizations, as well as\nimplementation of international CSR through geographical\ndiversification. Managerial interpretations of CSR as opportunities\nrather than as threats importantly facilitate the positive translation\nof CSR engagement into firm performance. This selective interpretation\nis dependent on the discretionary slack resources readily available to\nmanagers and the integration of CSR performance criteria into their\nperformance appraisals. The implementation of CSR practices are not\nwithout costs. To determine the appropriate level of CSR engagement,\nfirms need to take the demand and the supply of CSR-incorporated\nproducts into consideration. Most importantly, firms need to consider\nthe level of CSR engagement from its benefits and costs in the same way\nas in all other investments with a long-term forward thinking and\nopportunity seeking approach.

AB  - The bacterial community structure in soil of a tropical rainforest in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, where forest fires occurred in 1997-1998, was analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) with soil samples collected from the area in 2001 and 2002. The study sites were composed of a control forest area without fire damage, a lightly-burned forest area, and a heavily-burned forest area. DGGE band patterns showed that there were many common bacterial taxa across the areas although the vegetation is not the same. In addition, it was indicated that a change of vegetation in burned areas brought the change in bacterial community structure during 2001-2002. It was also indicated that, depending on a perspective, community structure of soil bacteria in post-fire non-climax forest several years after fire can be more heterogeneous compared with that in unburned climax forest. The dominant soil bacteria in the field of the present study were Acidobacteria, Actinobaceria, and Alphaproteobacteria based on the DNA sequences of DGGE bands, although they were not dominant among the culturable bacteria from the same soil samples.

AB  - Aboriginal people share a consistent landscape-burning practice across the vast Northern Australian savanna region. The practice is spatially and seasonally diverse and has been widely applied to manage important animal and plant resources and to bring about healthy and amenable landscape states. The burning practices of Aboriginal people and their associated knowledge systems provide valuable alternatives to Western scientific paradigms. Aboriginal people have experienced major demographic and cultural change in the post-colonial period, including the loss of access and ownership of land. Unmanaged wildfires now dominate contemporary fire regimes. with Aboriginal burning largely restricted to some Aboriginal lands. Scientific studies have linked recent changes in fire regime to the decline of key taxa, such as granivorous birds, small-sized to medium-sized mammals and fire-sensitive vegetation types. Aboriginal people remain important land managers in the savannas; representing a large proportion of the rural population, with large land holdings. and with influential land rights. Fire management continues on some Aboriginal lands and is being increasingly implemented by formal Aboriginal natural resource management agencies. The maintenance of indigenous ecological knowledge is also the focus of some indigenous-owned programs. Global climate change presents a new challenge to Aboriginal land managers but also presents opportunities for participation in the emerging carbon economy.

AB  - High Frequency Integrative Transformation I have been recently been obtaining higher frequencies of integrative transformation than those I described in previous gazette articles. The highest frequencies of transformation have come from experiments where I have injected oocyte nuclei in the proximal arm of very young adults (i.e adults which have fertilized only 1 to 3 oocytes). The current rate (with sup-7 injected into tra-3[am]) is one transformant in 5-10 injected worms [all accesible oocytes in each worm are injected]. Work per injected line has decreased proportionally to about 4 hr of 'real work' per transformed line. Injection Protocol My injection protocol is described in October 86 EMBO Journal -- here are some more suggestions: Rather than gently pushing the needle into the worm (which seems to greatly decrease viability) it is much healthier to drive the needle in with a rather VIOLENT 'whack' at the micromanipulator or microscope. The worms dont seem to mind this at all and can stand dozens of such injections and still The visibility of structures in the microscope provides a good assay for whether the animals to be injected have drled down too much on their agarose surface. If the proximal oocyte nuclei become invisible under the plan 40 nomarski, your worm is too dry. If this happens in less than ten minutes after the worms are mounted, then you should try thinner agarose pads (it will happen after a long time even with pads of the correct thickness, when starting out it is best to put only as many worms on a single pad as can be injected in about 10 minutes). If the worms are still moving around after 3 or 4 minutes, your pads are too thin, or the intermediate plate between transferring worms from their home to the pad was not sufficiently dry. Some batches of Voltalef 3S oil don't let worms stick permanently ( they stick and then come off). All other batches of 3S oil seem equivalent. (Several good batches of oil have been obtained at the MRC and good batches have also been obtained in Bloomington [J. Cane] and the Bronx [K. Nelson]). Heavy parafin oil (BDH product 29437 or equivalent) can also substitute for Voltalef 35 oil in the injection procedure without any obvious difference in the handling of the worms or in subsequent fertility, so there doesent seem to be anything magical about Voltalef oil. If you think you are having trouble obtaining oil that allows your worms to stick down to dry agarose pads, send me a small sample of your oil (lOOul) to the Carnegie and I will test it. If there is a problem I can send a small sample of a good batch. DNA concentration dependences(based on experiments done in collaboration with J. Cane and T. Blumenthal, and with R. Waterston) Integrated transformants have now been obtained at a variety of DNA concentrations from 60 ug/ml to 2 mg/ml. There doesn't seem to be huge dependance on the DNA concentration in this range but more data would be very useful on this point. Cosmids get difficult to inject at the high concentrations. X- gal I have switched to X-gal staining of worms carrying B-gal fusions. ( This seems more sensitive and avoids the nasty azo-dye coupling reagents used in the napthyl protocol.) A few crystals of X-gal are stuck in the bottom of a 1.5 ml microfuge tube and dissolved in lOul of dimethylformamide. One ml of 0.2M NaPhosphate pH 7.5 and 100 ul of oxidation buffer [50 mM KFerricyanide+50mM KFerrocyanide] are added, and the tube is vigorously mixed and spun in a microcentrifuge to pellet excess Xgal. The supernatant is added to 8ul of 1%SDS and added to pipetted onto worms that have been vacuum and acetone fixed as I described in the last newsletter (the acetone step is actually not necessary). In order to detect very weak signals, it is important to incubate the slides at 37 C. The Leitz dissecting microscopes give poor color resolution for seeing light blue stains; resolution is much better under the bright-field illumination of the Zeiss high power scopes. A Little More on HSP-Bgal expression CB4027 is a strain containing multiple integrated copies of a fusion between a D. italicter heat shock promoter region and E. coli B-gal (see last news letter). Histochemical staining of CB4027 animals heat shocked for different amounts of time reveals that the response turns on first in early embryos (after only 1 hr at 34 C) and only later in the pharynx (after >2 hr.) Also heat-shocked CB4027 late embryos have been stained with a polyclonal mouse antibody to B-gal (the antibody gives only background staining on unshocked CB4027 or wild type embryos). The staining in these embryos is most prominent in the gland cells in the pharynx, and in two cells in the tail, which only turn on the B-gal when the embryo is in the 2-2 1/2 fold stage. Expression of a MyoII-Bgal fusion in pharyngeal muscle Myo-2 is one of the two myosin isoforms that had been shown to be specific to the pharyngeal muscles. A fusion between the putative myoII promoter (from Ichi Murayama's sequence) and the B-gal coding region was constructed. This was introduced by cotransformation with sup-7. One of the resulting lines expresses the E. coli B-gal. When these animals are fixed and stained with X-gal as described above, staining appears only in the pharyngeal muscle. Both the suppression and B-gal activities breed true, a homozygote line has been established, and the pharyngeal B-gal activity and amber suppression activities cosegregate in outcrosses of this line. Although both B-gal constructs so far tested lead to pharyngeal staining, the pattern of B-gal expression in myoII-Bgal line is different from the pattern with the HSP-Bgal fusion construct: pharyngeal staining of animals transformed with the HSP-Bgal construct does not appear to be localized within muscle cells (I'm still not sure exactly what the localization in larvae and adults carrying HSP- Bgal is, but see above). Also, expression of the HSP-Bgal construct absolutely requires heat shock and also occurs in early embryos (early embryos are not stained in animals carrying the myoII-Bgal fusion). Obviously it would be nice to look at B-gal fusions using many promoters with a variety of different localizations. This could provide the best demonstration that patterns of tissue specific Bgal staining accurately reflect differences in promoter function rather than some odd properties of the B-gal segment.

The Leitz dissecting microscopes give poor color resolution for seeing light blue stains; resolution is much better under the bright-field illumination of the Zeiss high power scopes. A Little More on HSP-Bgal expression CB4027 is a strain containing multiple integrated copies of a fusion between a D. italicter heat shock promoter region and E. coli B-gal (see last news letter). Histochemical staining of CB4027 animals heat shocked for different amounts of time reveals that the response turns on first in early embryos (after only 1 hr at 34 C) and only later in the pharynx (after >2 hr.) Also heat-shocked CB4027 late embryos have been stained with a polyclonal mouse antibody to B-gal (the antibody gives only background staining on unshocked CB4027 or wild type embryos). The staining in these embryos is most prominent in the gland cells in the pharynx, and in two cells in the tail, which only turn on the B-gal when the embryo is in the 2-2 1/2 fold stage. Expression of a MyoII-Bgal fusion in pharyngeal muscle Myo-2 is one of the two myosin isoforms that had been shown to be specific to the pharyngeal muscles. A fusion between the putative myoII promoter (from Ichi Murayama's sequence) and the B-gal coding region was constructed. This was introduced by cotransformation with sup-7. One of the resulting lines expresses the E. coli B-gal. When these animals are fixed and stained with X-gal as described above, staining appears only in the pharyngeal muscle. Both the suppression and B-gal activities breed true, a homozygote line has been established, and the pharyngeal B-gal activity and amber suppression activities cosegregate in outcrosses of this line. Although both B-gal constructs so far tested lead to pharyngeal staining, the pattern of B-gal expression in myoII-Bgal line is different from the pattern with the HSP-Bgal fusion construct: pharyngeal staining of animals transformed with the HSP-Bgal construct does not appear to be localized within muscle cells (I'm still not sure exactly what the localization in larvae and adults carrying HSP- Bgal is, but see above). Also, expression of the HSP-Bgal construct absolutely requires heat shock and also occurs in early embryos (early embryos are not stained in animals carrying the myoII-Bgal fusion). Obviously it would be nice to look at B-gal fusions using many promoters with a variety of different localizations. This could provide the best demonstration that patterns of tissue specific Bgal staining accurately reflect differences in promoter function rather than some odd properties of the B-gal segment.

AB  - High Frequency Integrative Transformation I have been recently been obtaining higher frequencies of integrative transformation than those I described in previous gazette articles. The highest frequencies of transformation have come from experiments where I have injected oocyte nuclei in the proximal arm of very young adults (i.e adults which have fertilized only 1 to 3 oocytes). The current rate (with sup-7 injected into tra-3[am]) is one transformant in 5-10 injected worms [all accesible oocytes in each worm are injected]. Work per injected line has decreased proportionally to about 4 hr of 'real work' per transformed line. Injection Protocol My injection protocol is described in October 86 EMBO Journal -- here are some more suggestions: Rather than gently pushing the needle into the worm (which seems to greatly decrease viability) it is much healthier to drive the needle in with a rather VIOLENT 'whack' at the micromanipulator or microscope. The worms dont seem to mind this at all and can stand dozens of such injections and still The visibility of structures in the microscope provides a good assay for whether the animals to be injected have drled down too much on their agarose surface. If the proximal oocyte nuclei become invisible under the plan 40 nomarski, your worm is too dry. If this happens in less than ten minutes after the worms are mounted, then you should try thinner agarose pads (it will happen after a long time even with pads of the correct thickness, when starting out it is best to put only as many worms on a single pad as can be injected in about 10 minutes). If the worms are still moving around after 3 or 4 minutes, your pads are too thin, or the intermediate plate between transferring worms from their home to the pad was not sufficiently dry. Some batches of Voltalef 3S oil don't let worms stick permanently ( they stick and then come off). All other batches of 3S oil seem equivalent. (Several good batches of oil have been obtained at the MRC and good batches have also been obtained in Bloomington [J. Cane] and the Bronx [K. Nelson]). Heavy parafin oil (BDH product 29437 or equivalent) can also substitute for Voltalef 35 oil in the injection procedure without any obvious difference in the handling of the worms or in subsequent fertility, so there doesent seem to be anything magical about Voltalef oil. If you think you are having trouble obtaining oil that allows your worms to stick down to dry agarose pads, send me a small sample of your oil (lOOul) to the Carnegie and I will test it. If there is a problem I can send a small sample of a good batch. DNA concentration dependences(based on experiments done in collaboration with J. Cane and T. Blumenthal, and with R. Waterston) Integrated transformants have now been obtained at a variety of DNA concentrations from 60 ug/ml to 2 mg/ml. There doesn't seem to be huge dependance on the DNA concentration in this range but more data would be very useful on this point. Cosmids get difficult to inject at the high concentrations. X- gal I have switched to X-gal staining of worms carrying B-gal fusions. ( This seems more sensitive and avoids the nasty azo-dye coupling reagents used in the napthyl protocol.) A few crystals of X-gal are stuck in the bottom of a 1.5 ml microfuge tube and dissolved in lOul of dimethylformamide. One ml of 0.2M NaPhosphate pH 7.5 and 100 ul of oxidation buffer [50 mM KFerricyanide+50mM KFerrocyanide] are added, and the tube is vigorously mixed and spun in a microcentrifuge to pellet excess Xgal. The supernatant is added to 8ul of 1%SDS and added to pipetted onto worms that have been vacuum and acetone fixed as I described in the last newsletter (the acetone step is actually not necessary). In order to detect very weak signals, it is important to incubate the slides at 37 C.

AB  - LADM is a international standard for the land administration domain. It will stimulate the development of software applications and will accelerate the implementation of proper land administration systems that will support sustainable development. The LADM covers basic information-related components of land administration (including those over water and land, and elements above and below the surface of the earth); The standard provides an abstract, conceptual model with three packages related to: - parties (people and organizations); - basic administrative units, rights, responsibilities, and restrictions (ownership rights); - spatial units (parcels, and the legal space of buildings and utility networks); with sub packages for spatial sources (surveying), and spatial representations (geometry and topology). This paper summarizes the motivation, requirements and goals for developing LADM. Further, the standard itself is described, including the development process and potential future maintenance. Despite being a very young standard, ‘born’ on 1 December 2012, it is already possible to observe some of the impact of LADM and some examples of this are given in the paper.

AB  - Failure to recognize land administration systems as infrastructure creates potential funding and maintenance problems. Wider economic, social, and environmental benefits of effective land administration are consequently put at risk. Land administration must be recognized as critical, public good infrastructure. An evaluation method for testing land administration as an infrastructure is developed and applied. The method utilizes tools for defining and classifying infrastructure, public goods, and critical infrastructures. Arguments for land administration as infrastructure are revealed to reside within the land administration discipline: mainstream views regularly fail to recognize the argument. Reasons include the internal focus of scientific disciplines, the failure of land administrators to engage across disciplines, the global disparity of approaches to land administration, and the lack of visible or physical presence for land administration infrastructure. The results of three empirical studies support the notion that land administration is a critical, public good infrastructure. It concluded that infrastructure funding and maintenance regimes need to be depoliticized, potentially through the development of evidence based metrics, that land administrators must continue to promote land administration outwardly, and that the evaluation approach be extended and enhanced for use in directed land administration projects and studies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With growing awareness of fire hazard as an environmental threat within tropical rainforests, the state of Brazil initiated a set of fire control policies aimed at monitoring and ameliorating fire hazard in the Amazon region. These policies were developed in the aftermath of large-scale fire events and reflect a conservationist discourse that responded to internal as well as international environmental concerns. In doing so, the policies have framed the "fire problem" around those who use fire in their land use practices, in particular small-scale agriculturalists. Yet, land policy in general has repeatedly failed to address the institutional arrangements which compel small-scale farmers to use fire in their agricultural practices and the underlying development processes that have made the landscape more vulnerable to accidental spread of fire. Using regional level data on small-scale farmers, I suggest that the conservation oriented approach of fire policy may not be enough to curtail accidental fire events and instead that the fire issue needs to be positioned within rural development as well. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the last few years, due to the global warming and draught related to it, there is an increase in the number of forest fires. Forest fire detection is mainly done by people but there exists some automated systems in this field too. Besides the detection of the forest fires, effective fire extinguishing has an important role in fire fighting. If the spread of the fire can be predicted from the starting, early intervene can be achieved and fire can be extinguished swiftly. Using the fire propagation simulator explained here it is aimed, to predict the fire development beforehand and to visulalize this predictions on a 3D-GIS environment.

AB  - In the last gazette, I reported that coinjection of one plasmid carrying the amber suppressor sup-7 (used as a selectable marker) with a second, unselected plasmid could be used to obtain stably transformed lines which contain sequences from the second plasmid in addition to sup-7 DNA. I have used this to introduce a plasmid pShZ2 ( from Sean Munro) carrying a Drosophila heat shock promoter (HSP) fused to sequences coding for E. Coli -galactosidase (see diagram). Of three independent stably transformed lines derived from these injections, two (CB4027 and CB4028) were analyzed on southern blots and found to contain the HSP- -gal fusion segment in apparently unrearranged form. -galactosidase activities from these transformed lines have been compared with control lines both by soluble enzyme assays and by histochemical staining. 1. SOLUBLE ENZYME ACTIVITIES: Worms were grown on a bacterial strain deleted for the -galactosidase gene , harvested as L4s and homogenized by sonication (painful on the ears) or by a new 'sandblasting' method (see below). The resulting lysates were incubated with ONP -Galactoside (yellow product) or 4- Methylumbelliferyl -Galactoside (fluorescent product) and enzyme activities determined spectrophotometrically. A very low basal level of enzyme activity was detected both in the parental line, and in sup- 7 transformed lines not carrying the HSP- -gal fusion. This basal level was not affected by heat shock (3 hours at 34 C). Under normal growth conditions (20 C) the two lines carrying the HSP- -gal fusion produce levels of -galactosidase similar to the parent line (within 2- fold). After heat shock, a striking increase of 10-20 fold in galactosidase level is seen with both CB4027 and CB4028. 2. HISTOCHEMICAL STAINING: Whole worms were fixed and stained for gal activity as described below. No staining was observed in the parental line (with or without heat shock) or in CB4027 or CB4028 growing at 20 C. After heat shock, strong and reproducible staining of both CB4027 and CB4028 was observed (>95% of the animals stain). The staining appears almost exclusively in the pharynx (all stages) and in embryos. The localization of the stain is unlikely to reflect a simple permeability difference, since squashed and/or cut animals show similar patterns of staining. Additionally, injection of pure enzyme into the gonad, gut or pharynx of wild type animals followed by fixation and staining as above resulted in specific staining in each case of only the injected tissue. Histochemical staining is being used to examine the segregation of the inducible galactosidase activity: Preliminary evidence suggests that multiple loci (2-3) in CB4027 carry functional HSP- -gal segments. In particular at least one locus unlinked to the amber suppression activity (which maps on chromosome IV(L) near unc-17) can confer heat inducible gal activity. This is consistent with estimates of copy number for the gene fusion, between 5 and 20 for the two strains. The possibility of extrachromosomal inheritance for the transgenic HSP- - gal loci cannot yet be ruled out but seems unlikely due to the DNA copy number and the fact that inducible gal activities have been maintained in the two strains in the absence of selection for over 30 generations. A rough estimate of the induced -Galactosidase as a fraction of total protein can be obtained either from soluble enzyme assays or from histochemistry (by comparison with injections of pure enzyme). These estimates on the order of .001% and .01% respectively (the difference may reflect losses in solubilizing the enzyme). Why is staining in induced animals limited to the pharynx? Obvious suspects include the nature of the worm heat shock response, the synthetic rates and stabilities of -gal protein and message in different tissues, and possible fortuitous expression signals in the HSP- -gal fusion plasmid that was used. In any case the strains may prove useful in finding nematodes on warm summer nights. SAND EXTRACT: To worms (10-100 l) in a 1.5ml microfuge tube are added about equal volumes of buffer and acid washed fine grain sand. The tube is then agitated vigourously-- I do this by striking the bottom of the tube along the pegs of a plastic (Gilson) test tube rack 10-20 times (like bad, loud guitar playing). Sand can be removed by centrifugation or filtration. All the worms are lysed and completely broken up by this procedure and recovery of total protein and enzyme activity appear comparable to sonication. -GAL STAIN: Wash worms in water and place in drop on a slide (I use 4-well multitest slides). Dry slides 5-10 min in a dessicator jar under vacuum (<2mbar). Dip the dried slides in acetone and dry on benchtop. Add 100 l of staining solution [0.2M NaPhosphate pH 7.5, 1. 0mMDTT; saturate with substrate (6Bromo2NapthylBDgalactoside from Sigma) and add 0.004% SDS] for 1 hr at room temperature. Then add 20 l of 0.125% 'fast blue B diazonium salt' [BDH], mix well, and staining should appear within 10-20 min. The substrate is cleaved by - galactosidase to yield a local insoluble precipitate of 6Bromo2Napthol; this reacts with the diazotized Fast Blue to form insoluble turquoise dye (Rutenberg et al J. Histochem. and Cytochem. 6, 122). The fast blue must be dissolved (H20) just prior to use or a nasty orange stain develops which can obscure the reaction product. Some staining near the mouth in induced live worms can be obtained using this protocol without drying and acetone steps. [See Figure 1]

SAND EXTRACT: To worms (10-100 l) in a 1.5ml microfuge tube are added about equal volumes of buffer and acid washed fine grain sand.

Sand can be removed by centrifugation or filtration. All the worms are lysed and completely broken up by this procedure and recovery of total protein and enzyme activity appear comparable to sonication. -GAL STAIN: Wash worms in water and place in drop on a slide (I use 4-well multitest slides). Dry slides 5-10 min in a dessicator jar under vacuum (<2mbar). Dip the dried slides in acetone and dry on benchtop. Add 100 l of staining solution [0.2M NaPhosphate pH 7.5, 1. 0mMDTT; saturate with substrate (6Bromo2NapthylBDgalactoside from Sigma) and add 0.004% SDS] for 1 hr at room temperature. Then add 20 l of 0.125% 'fast blue B diazonium salt' [BDH], mix well, and staining should appear within 10-20 min. The substrate is cleaved by - galactosidase to yield a local insoluble precipitate of 6Bromo2Napthol; this reacts with the diazotized Fast Blue to form insoluble turquoise dye (Rutenberg et al J. Histochem. and Cytochem. 6, 122). The fast blue must be dissolved (H20) just prior to use or a nasty orange stain develops which can obscure the reaction product. Some staining near the mouth in induced live worms can be obtained using this protocol without drying and acetone steps. [See Figure 1]

AB  - In the last gazette, I reported that coinjection of one plasmid carrying the amber suppressor sup-7 (used as a selectable marker) with a second, unselected plasmid could be used to obtain stably transformed lines which contain sequences from the second plasmid in addition to sup-7 DNA. I have used this to introduce a plasmid pShZ2 ( from Sean Munro) carrying a Drosophila heat shock promoter (HSP) fused to sequences coding for E. Coli -galactosidase (see diagram). Of three independent stably transformed lines derived from these injections, two (CB4027 and CB4028) were analyzed on southern blots and found to contain the HSP- -gal fusion segment in apparently unrearranged form. -galactosidase activities from these transformed lines have been compared with control lines both by soluble enzyme assays and by histochemical staining. 1. SOLUBLE ENZYME ACTIVITIES: Worms were grown on a bacterial strain deleted for the -galactosidase gene , harvested as L4s and homogenized by sonication (painful on the ears) or by a new 'sandblasting' method (see below). The resulting lysates were incubated with ONP -Galactoside (yellow product) or 4- Methylumbelliferyl -Galactoside (fluorescent product) and enzyme activities determined spectrophotometrically. A very low basal level of enzyme activity was detected both in the parental line, and in sup- 7 transformed lines not carrying the HSP- -gal fusion. This basal level was not affected by heat shock (3 hours at 34 C). Under normal growth conditions (20 C) the two lines carrying the HSP- -gal fusion produce levels of -galactosidase similar to the parent line (within 2- fold). After heat shock, a striking increase of 10-20 fold in galactosidase level is seen with both CB4027 and CB4028. 2. HISTOCHEMICAL STAINING: Whole worms were fixed and stained for gal activity as described below. No staining was observed in the parental line (with or without heat shock) or in CB4027 or CB4028 growing at 20 C. After heat shock, strong and reproducible staining of both CB4027 and CB4028 was observed (>95% of the animals stain). The staining appears almost exclusively in the pharynx (all stages) and in embryos. The localization of the stain is unlikely to reflect a simple permeability difference, since squashed and/or cut animals show similar patterns of staining. Additionally, injection of pure enzyme into the gonad, gut or pharynx of wild type animals followed by fixation and staining as above resulted in specific staining in each case of only the injected tissue. Histochemical staining is being used to examine the segregation of the inducible galactosidase activity: Preliminary evidence suggests that multiple loci (2-3) in CB4027 carry functional HSP- -gal segments. In particular at least one locus unlinked to the amber suppression activity (which maps on chromosome IV(L) near unc-17) can confer heat inducible gal activity. This is consistent with estimates of copy number for the gene fusion, between 5 and 20 for the two strains. The possibility of extrachromosomal inheritance for the transgenic HSP- - gal loci cannot yet be ruled out but seems unlikely due to the DNA copy number and the fact that inducible gal activities have been maintained in the two strains in the absence of selection for over 30 generations. A rough estimate of the induced -Galactosidase as a fraction of total protein can be obtained either from soluble enzyme assays or from histochemistry (by comparison with injections of pure enzyme). These estimates on the order of .001% and .01% respectively (the difference may reflect losses in solubilizing the enzyme). Why is staining in induced animals limited to the pharynx? Obvious suspects include the nature of the worm heat shock response, the synthetic rates and stabilities of -gal protein and message in different tissues, and possible fortuitous expression signals in the HSP- -gal fusion plasmid that was used.

AB  - Future changes in land use in the coastal zone will be dominated by the effects of climate change. The major effect of climate change on the coastal zone will be due to increasing sea level which, in combination with possible increases in the frequency and intensity of storms, will bring about:•change in patterns of erosion and sedimentation•increased risk of flooding•change in the distribution and types of coastal habitats. The coastline has always been subject to change through erosion and other natural processes. Climate change may speed this change. This will mean profound impacts on low-lying coastal areas over the next 50 years, particularly along the eastern coast of England. These physical changes in the coastal zone will occur alongside, and interact with, a variety of human impacts and drivers of change. Agricultural policy reform, and changes in production in response to this and to climate change, will alter coastal landscapes as well as sediment and nutrient inputs into coastal waters. Demographic change – an increasing UK population, who are on average older and who potentially have more leisure time – will be likely to bring about an increased demand for the recreational opportunities that the coast provides. This will mean more demand for land for housing and recreational facilities. A continuing trend of rising income levels may also fuel further demand for imported goods and hence the need for further port development, particularly in the south east of England. Coastal landscapes are also likely to be heavily impacted by the construction of renewable energy infrastructure, i.e. offshore wind farms and wave and tidal power projects.

AB  - A right of commoners to pastures existed since the Early Middle Ages in Anglo-Saxon England and the European mainland, including Tyrol in Austria. Lowland commons institutions were largely dissolved by the 19th century; however, in the European Alps contiguous commons remain alive. Some two thousand alpine commons institutions are registered in the Tyrolean parcel cadaster and land registry. A specific study of West-Tyrolean commons (known as Agrargemeinschaft or AGMs), framed by Ostrom's design principles is presented. General lessons for land policy and land administration are extracted. An interview period was split between the Inn valley and the ??tztal. Roughly half are considered independent: others are regulated by the Tyrolean Agricultural Authority. Some AGMs hold the full bundle of land rights: others only hold pastoral and forestry rights. AGMs consisted either of a single cadastral parcel or several contiguous parcels. In the Inn valley villages the pastoral commons were owned by the municipalities, while in the researched ??tztal, AGMs are frequently the full owners of the commons. AGM membership ranges between 5 and 60 farm households. The number of livestock units pastured was in most cases stipulated in approved regulations. Alpine commons larger than 200. ha are also hunting-zones: revenue is collected from the lease of hunting rights. Most of the alpine commons are designated and used as ski-zones. Upper portions of two alpine commons in the ??tztal are state protected natural areas. The number of farms with pastoral rights is declining at District and State level. Key lessons for land policy and land administration include: Ostrom's design principles being a precondition rather than a panacea; commons institutions requiring one clear ownership party; both public and collective ownership producing success; publically owned commons requiring a local representative; small membership numbers being preferable; small shareholdings not being preferable; decentralized governance being beneficial; internal democratic elections being beneficial; internal boundary records being superfluous; explicit sanctions being superfluous; mixed economies being acceptable; and geography being a significant influence on the longevity of pastoral commons. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It analyses how a more sustainable pattern of development can be achieved by use of an open-space network integrated into the urban structure. The trade-off between the maintenance of a good quality urban environment and continued economic development is central to the analysis. This leads to the suggestion of a planning approach that permits the retention and incorporation of natural areas and other open spaces within the urban structure, that combats rapid urban expansion and furthers the goal of sustainable development. The conclusions serve as a starting point for the planning of other cities in similar circumstances.

AB  - An empirical assessment of the interaction between the land use—transportation system and travel behavior is presented. A methodology for identifying a range of land use—transportation systems by a clustering technique with network and land use inputs was developed. Twenty neighborhoods from Orange County, California, were considered in this process. Three groups, or themes, were found to best represent the neighborhoods in the sample area: one each associated with the conventional definition of traditional and neotraditional neighborhood design (TND) and planned unit development (PUD) neighborhoods and one representing neighborhoods that blend characteristics of TND and PUD. Conventional measures of individual travel behavior were compared with an analysis of variance between the themes to identify significant differences, controlling for socioeconomic characteristics. Research results include the development of (a) a systematic methodology to identify a more explicit land use—transportation dimension, (b) an estimate of the potential effectiveness of design-oriented solutions to reduce automobile congestion by using the developed themes, and (c) a preliminary assessment of the extent to which development themes can be used to improve the current modeling framework.

AB  - Current fire models are designed to model the spread of a linear fire front in dead, small-diameter fuels. Fires in predominantly living vegetation account for a large proportion of annual burned area in the United States. Prescribed burning is used to manage living fuels; however, prescribed burning is currently conducted under conditions that result in marginal burning. We do not understand quantitatively the relative importance of the fuel and environmental variables that determine spread in live vegetation. To address these weaknesses, laboratory fires have been burned to determine the effects of wind, slope, moisture content and fuel characteristics on fire spread in fuel beds of common chaparral species. Four species ( Adenostoma fasciculatum, Ceanothus crassifolius, Quercus berberidifolia, Arctostaphylos parryana), two wind velocities ( 0 and 2m s(-1)) and two fuel bed depths ( 20 and 40 cm) were used. Oven-dry moisture content of fine fuels (< 0.63 cm diameter) ranged from 0.09 to 1.06. Seventy of 125 fires successfully propagated the length ( 2.0 m) of the elevated fuel bed. A logistic model to predict the probability of successful fire spread was developed using stepwise logistic regression. The variables selected to predict propagation were wind velocity, slope percent, moisture content, fuel loading, species and air temperature. Air temperature and species terms were removed from the model for parsimony. The final model correctly classified 94% of the observations. Comparison of results with an empirical decision matrix for prescribed burning in chaparral suggested some agreement between the laboratory data and the empirical tool.

AB  - A simplified physical model for the steady-state propagation of an infinite fire front through a uniform forest fuel bed in still air is derived from a mechanistic approach that considers a forest fire as a compressible, reactive and radiative flow through a multiphase medium. <p>This model, named the PIF97 model for shortness, includes the effects of the buoyancy induced gas flow on the preheating of the unburned fuel. Fuel is composed of one type of motionless particles uniformly distributed in a fuel bed of constant depth. The conservation equations used in the model are integrated over the fuel bed depth. The spatial domain is divided into the preheating zone ahead of the fire front and the flaming combustion zone. In the preheating zone (model A), pyrolysis and chemical reactions are neglected, and the gas flow is assumed to be one-dimensional. In the flaming combustion zone (model B), some average parameters over this zone are given in order to simplify the description of physical and chemical processes. Models A and B are coupled to form the PIF97 model.</p> <p>The predictions of this model are compared with experimental rates of spread measured during laboratory fire experiments in pine needle fuel beds. That shows the accomplished progress by comparison to the predictions of a purely radiative model and also the limits of the PIF97 model. Under the present experimental conditions, this model correctly predicts the effect of surface-to-volume ratio, and may predict the effect of fuel load, but the quantitative effect of slope is clearly underestimated. Possible reasons for the remaining discrepancies between predictions and experimental results are investigated through an analysis of separate predictions of model A and model B.</p>

This research investigates the efficacy of using simulation in teaching the topic of transportation network growth through an experiment conducted at the Civil Engineering Department of the University of Minnesota. In the experiment, a network growth simulator program (SONG) was incorporated into a senior/graduate class in transportation system analysis. Results of the experiment show that the use of SONG effectively enhanced students' learning in terms of helping students develop in-depth understanding about the development process of network patterns, and helped them develop some aspects of judgment, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. However the use of SONG may have been more effective had some other barriers to learning been overcome.

AB  - In response to a shift towards performance-based building regulations, fire services in Australia have developed a method for quantifying their operations. This method has been released for general use by the fire safety design industry and is known as "The Fire Brigade Intervention Model". It is an event-based methodology that considers the time taken for the various fire brigade functions to be performed. It allows for concurrent and sequential activities - an ingredient missing from previous attempts at modelling firefighting operations. Flow through the algorithm is controlled by the fireground status which is a time-evolving representation of the state-of-affairs faced by an incident controller. It incorporates quantities representing the state of the fire as provided by other models and the available fire brigade resources. The strategy to be implemented is based upon it. Complementing the methodology is the associated data on various firefighting activities. This was collected through field testing. Results are distributed in time and depending on the margin for safety desired, a value for the time to complete a given task can be included at the appropriate point in the calculation. The final result depends on a critical time path through the range of activities that are undertaken. This final time represents the total time for fire brigade operations for the building and fire scenario under consideration. This gives designers a rational quantification of fire brigade operations to be used in the design process. Copyright © International Association for Fire Safety Science.

AB  - The Amazon is being rapidly transformed by fire. Logging and forest fragmentation sharply elevate fire incidence by increasing forest desiccation and fuel loads, and forests that have experienced a low-intensity surface fire are vulnerable to far more catastrophic fires. Satellites typically detect thermal signatures from 40 000 to 50 000 separate fires in the Amazon each year, and this number could increase as new highways and infrastructure expand across the basin. Many are concerned that large-scale deforestation, by reducing regional evapotranspiration and creating moisture-trapping smoke plumes, will make the basin increasingly vulnerable to fire. The Amazon may also be affected by future global warming and atmospheric changes, although much remains uncertain. Most models suggest the basin will become warmer throughout this century, although there is no consensus about how precipitation will be affected. The most alarming scenarios project a permanent disruption of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, leading to greatly increased drought or destructive synergisms between regional and global climate change in the Amazon.

The work promotes the need for land use and land cover to be maintained as distinct concepts in data collection activities.

AB  - Currently there are no internationally accepted methodologies to evaluate and compare the performance of land administration systems. This is partly because land administration systems are in constant reform, and probably more importantly, they represent societies' different perceptions of land. This paper describes the development of a framework to measure and compare the performance of land administration systems. The research is of particular relevance since it develops a management model which links the operational aspects of land administration with land policy.

AB  - Fire hazard assessments must be primarily driven by life safety variables. Concern is often highly focused on toxicity issues, since fire deaths, in the majority of cases, are found (in whole or in part) to be due to toxic gas inhalation. Procedures have recently been published by ISO, wherein the toxicity assessment of fire products is focused primarily on bench-scale testing for toxic potency (the lsquoper-gram toxicityrsquo). Yet hazards of products with regards to fire toxicity may be determined much more by their differences in burning rates than by any differences in toxic potency. Burning rates are not assessed in the pertinent standards (ISO 13344 and ISO TR 9122). For most product categories, techniques for predicting full-scale burning rates from bench-scale data are not yet in hand. Thus, today the best means of comparing actual, full-scale toxic fire hazards is the full-scale fire test, equipped with additional gas measuring instrumentation. Such an approach is not among the recommended methods of the international standards, yet it is the only one with innate validity. In the present work, a series of sandwich panel products were tested in a full-scale room configuration. Bench-scale comparison was made to the ISO 5660 Cone Calorimeter and the DIN 53436 tube furnace. The toxic gases were quantified in all cases by chemical analysis. The product which showed the best performance in the full-scale tests (rock wool insulated sandwich panel) did not achieve a good fire toxicity performance due to minimization of toxic potency. Instead, the successful performance was attributed wholly to reduction of burning rate. Bench-scale measurements of toxic potency were shown to lack relevance to reality in such cases where even the full-scale toxic potency is not a determining factor. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This draft conceptual paper on micro-macro relations proposes a framework that observations and findings from each subproject (SP) can be referred to. It might therefore better embed (theoretically and methodologically) each SP and contribute to the cohesion between all SPs. In particular for those SPs that have not yet started or still are at an early stage, the paper should offer a framework for formulating hypotheses to be used during the implementation of each SP. The point of departure of the conceptual paper is the description of the project submitted to the European Commission as an annex to the application. The work on this draft paper has been sparked off by comments from the EC and the review team on the need to elaborate on the cohesion between all subprojects. In the following chapters the structure of LLL2010 is first presented while outlining how it intends to cover a micro, meso and macro level of analysis. Chapter 3 is devoted to the conceptual framework as such, and sets out to explain how characteristics of LLL can be used for making typologies of LLL. The fourth chapter is an attempt to illustrate how LLL characteristics can be measured by splitting them into various dimensions leading to LLL indicators. The last chapter discusses implications of LLL characteristics and typologies for the LLL2010 subprojects and traces some of the expected outcomes of the entire project.

AB  - It has been theorized that the amount of fuel involved in a fire front can influence the rate of spread of the fire. Three data sets are examined in an attempt to prove this relationship. The first, a Canadian Forest Service database of over 400 experimental, wild, and prescribed fires showed a weak relationship in some fuel complexes. The second, a series of field experimental fires conducted to isolate the relationship, showed a small effect. The final data set, from a series of 47 small plots (3m x 3m) burned with a variety of fuel loadings, also show a weak relationship. While a relationship was shown to exist, it is debatable whether it should be included in a fire behavior prediction system. Inherent errors associated with predicting fuel consumption can be compounded, causing additional, more critical, errors with the derived fire spread rate.

AB  - If a bushfire is spreading in a quasi-steady way, only changing on a long time scale in comparison to the burnout time τb, Byram’s first formula for fireline intensity I = QmR provides a simple energy balance ( R is the spread rate of the fire, m is the fuel load and Q is the energy released per unit mass of fuel burnt). However, Byram’s second formula for fireline intensity I = Qϖd is a better approximation under unsteady conditions when Byram’s first formula is not valid (ϖ= m τb is the mean pyrolysis rate or mass-loss rate of the vegetation per unit area within the fire). The flame depth d is simply the distance the fire has travelled over the past burnout time, so that d = R(t −τ) dτ where τ is the elapsed time after flaming is initiated at any point in the fire. ∫0 τb The rate of mass loss ϖ is not constant, in general, being determined by the way in which the fire engages and degrades the vegetation structurally and over time within the flaming region. A simplified but realistic formula arises if ϖ is represented as a function of the elapsed time τ, in the form ϖ=ψ(τ) × m/τb. Byram’s second formula then becomes I = Qm ψ(τ)R(t −τ) dτ/τb , ∫0 τb in whichψ(τ) serves as a weighting function, representing how changes in the energy release rate develop as burning progresses in the vegetation above any small area of ground. A dynamical model for fire spread then arises naturally since the spread rate R must itself be a function of the intensity I in some manner, such as R = R (I ,R ) , where R is the steady or equilibrium spread rate at which I = I = QmR under steady conditions. The equilibrium spread rate R itself would depend on slope, local wind speed, moisture content, fuel load and the structure of the vegetation. In considering the dynamics of a fireline it is useful to introduce the dimensionless ratio B = QmR I which may be called the Byram number. Deviation of the Byram number from unity indicates unsteadiness of a fireline: a fire tends to be intensifying or waxing if B > 1 and waning if B < 1. As yet there is very little hard data for the unsteady dependence of spread-rate on intensity because the paradigm for most bushfire research has focused on steady fire spread. But the formulation above for intensity and spread-rate dynamics does help to explain some observed behaviour. For example, oscillatory fire spread was reported by Gould et al (2007) in which wind dominated a low intensity fire so that it spread quickly, but the wind was blocked by the fire at higher intensity leading to a low spread rate. A significant delay in the growth of intensity through the factor ψ(τ) favours this kind of behaviour along with suitable modelling of R = R (I ,R ) to allow for bimodal spread under separated and attached flow conditions. Another example is simply the initial development of a fire from a line ignition, which normally approaches a stable equilibrium spread rate. Any form of the dependence of R on I in which the Byram number remains at or above a value greater than unity over a range of intensities leads to an eruptive form of fire growth (Dold and Zinoviev, 2009; Dold 2010).

And we owe a debt to accident for some of our deepest scientific knowledge, including Newton's theory of gravitation, the Big Bang theory of Creation, and the discovery of DNA. Even the Rosetta Stone, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the ruins of Pompeii came to light through chance. This book tells the fascinating stories of these and other discoveries and reveals how the inquisitive human mind turns accident into discovery. Written for the layman, yet scientifically accurate, this illuminating collection of anecdotes portrays invention and discovery as quintessentially human acts, due in part to curiosity, perserverance, and luck.

AB  - The use of the terms "growth" and "acceleration" appears to be inconsistent in the literature and we believe this inconsistency has hindered our understanding of behaviour in the early stages of a fire. The development of a fire from a point ignition to some equilibrium state and the associated increase in fire size and intensity has been referred to variously as the fire growth (Pyne 1984); build-up (Luke and McArthur 1978); or acceleration (Chandler et al. 1983) phase of the fire. More specifically the "acceleration phase" has been used to describe the increase in rate of spread from ignition to a quasi-steady rate of spread (Luke and McArthur 1978, McAlpine and Wakimoto 1991). Characteristic curves showing the increase in rate of spread are illustrated for different fuel and weather conditions (Luke and McArthur 1978). Hypothetical models to describe these curves have been proposed by Cheney and Bary (1969), Van Wagner (unpublished) and McAlpine and Wakimoto (1991). They have been called acceleration curves and acceleration models. The terms growth and acceleration, however, represent different concepts that are not interchangeable. We would like to clarify these concepts and discuss the practical implications for fire managers.

AB  - In Vietnam, a quasi-private property regime has been established in 1993 with the issuance of exchangeable and mortgageable long-term land use right certificates. Using primary qualitative and quantitative data collected in a mountainous district of Northern Vietnam, this paper investigates the role of the land policy in the adoption of soil conservation technologies by farmers. This issue is of crucial importance in the region where population growth and growing market demands have induced farmers to intensify agricultural production. While poverty has been reduced, environmental problems such as soil erosion, landslides, and declining soil fertility have become more severe over the past years. Our findings suggest that despite farmers' awareness of erosion, soil conservation technologies are perceived as being economically unattractive; therefore, most upland farmers continue to practice the prevailing erosion-prone cultivation system. Focusing on agroforestry as one major soil conservation option, we estimate household and plot-level econometric models to empirically assess the determinants of adoption. We find that the possession of a formal land title positively influences adoption, but that the threat of land reallocations in villages discourages adoption by creating uncertainty and tenure insecurity. The analyses reveal that these two effects interact with each other but are of small magnitude. We conclude that the issuance of land titles is a necessary but not sufficient prerequisite to encouraging the adoption of soil conservation practices. However, current practices remain economically unattractive to farmers. This deficiency needs to be addressed by interdisciplinary research and complemented by strong efforts by local authorities to promote sustainable land use. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The village Damarpota has experienced transformation of 274&#xa0;ha (79%) of its prime quality rice fields into shrimp farms during the period between 1985 and 2003. Prolonged shrimp farming for 5-, 10-, and 15-year period has increased soil salinity, acidity, and depleted soil Ca, K, Mg, and organic C content of all three types of soils in the villages to a variable degree and caused soil degradation that significantly affected the rice yield. Declined yield and acreage of rice jointly reduced the total production of rice and animal fodder. Soil degradation and loss of acreage under rice have threatened the sustainability of the village rice ecosystem.

AB  - Changes in ecological concepts and a new focus on biodiversity as a central objective have led to changes in fire policies in South African savanna parks. Prescribed burning using fixed fire intervals is being replaced by systems that promote more variable fire regimes and greater management flexibility. Three policy alternatives have been proposed for Kruger National Park: a lightning fire policy, patch mosaic burning, and burning based on ecological criteria. There is no agreement as yet on which policy to adopt. However there is growing consensus on the use of a management system using &#39;thresholds of potential concern&#39; to evaluate the outcome of different policies. These thresholds have been established for numerous indicators, help focus monitoring activities, and guide managers on the need for active intervention. We discuss the applicability of the policy alternatives for preventing successional change from savanna to forest and promoting grazing lawns and their associated grazers. We conclude that none of the current policies is universally applicable. A prescriptive program of frequent, high intensity burns will be required in mesic savannas to prevent succession to forests. In arid savannas, fire regimes designed to promote variable fire frequencies and fire sizes would be preferred to maintain greater diversity of grassland swards and grazer communities. The lessons learned from fire policy debates in South African savannas are of wider relevance for managing conservation areas elsewhere.

AB  - As part of an ongoing research project to investigate the performance in fire of specific types of innovative construction products and techniques (ICPT), BRE Global have carried out large-scale fire tests to determine the response of different floor systems to a realistic fire scenario. The principal objective was to determine the mode of failure of different floor systems to provide information to key stakeholders (particularly the Fire and Rescue Service), which can be taken into account in the dynamic risk assessments that underpin fire fighting operations. This paper presents the results and observations from those fire tests for three floor systems: (i) solid timber floor joists, (ii) I-section floor beams with solid timber top and bottom flanges and an oriented strand board (OSB) web, and (iii) a timber truss incorporating solid timber upper and lower chord members and a pressed steel web member.

AB  - The decade since the initiation of the Land-Use/Cover Change (LUCC) project in 1995 (see Chap. 1) has witnessed considerable advances in the field of modeling of land-use/cover change. The science plan of the project indicated that the major task would be the development of a new generation of land-use/cover change models capable of simulating the major socioeconomic and biophysical driving forces of land-use and land-cover change. In addition, these models were supposed to be able to handle interactions at several spatial and temporal scales. Recent publications indicate that the LUCC science community has successfully met this challenge and a wide range of advanced models, aiming at different scales and research questions, is now available (Briassoulis 2000; Agarwal et al. 2001; Veldkamp and Lambin 2001; Parker et al. 2003; Nagendra et al. 2004; Veldkamp and Verburg 2004; Verburg et al. 2004b; Verburg and Veldkamp 2005). One of the most important observations that can be made examining the range of available land-use/ cover change models is the wide variety of approaches and concepts underlying the models. This chapter intends to describe the variety of modeling approaches, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches and indicate the remaining challenges for the land-use science community. Not being able to discuss all individual models and approaches, we will focus on broad distinctions between approaches and discuss how modelers have dealt with a number of important aspects of the functioning of the landuse system. A land-use system is understood here as a type of land use with interrelated determining factors with strong functional relations with each other (see Fig. 1.2). These factors include a wide range of land-use influencing factors than can be biophysical, economic, social, cultural, political, or institutional.

AB  - An evaluation method for urban post-earthquake fire risk is presented. Urban fires and urban evacuations are highly dependent on uncertain factors, such as the number and locations of fire outbreaks, the wind velocity and direction, and the population distribution. To implement effective measures to ensure the safety of buildings and individuals in fires, a method to evaluate the effectiveness of the various safety measures that consider the influence of the uncertain factors is essential. Risk is introduced into the proposed method, in which the risk is defined as the probability that the ratio of burned-down buildings or fire fatalities in a district will exceed a threshold within a given time period after an earthquake. The risk is calculated by a combination of Monte Carlo simulation and physics-based fire-spread/evacuation simulation, in which uncertainty is considered in the following inputs: (1) the number and locations of fire outbreaks; (2) the firefighting at the initial stages; (3) the weather; (4) the earthquake-related structural damage to buildings; (5) the initial evacuee locations and (6) the obstruction of roads. In this paper, the risk of Kyoto City was evaluated for eight types of inland earthquake to demonstrate the use of the model. As a result, the effectiveness of countermeasures that improve the fire resistance of buildings could be quantified in terms of risk reduction. This result indicates that the method could be an effective tool for disaster prevention. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Urban fires and urban evacuations are highly dependent on uncertain factors, such as the number and locations of fire outbreaks, the wind velocity and direction, and the population distribution. To implement effective measures to ensure the safety of buildings and individuals in fires, a method to evaluate the effectiveness of the various safety measures that consider the influence of the uncertain factors is essential. Risk is introduced into the proposed method, in which the risk is defined as the probability that the ratio of burned-down buildings or fire fatalities in a district will exceed a threshold within a given time period after an earthquake. The risk is calculated by a combination of Monte Carlo simulation and physics-based fire-spread/evacuation simulation, in which uncertainty is considered in the following inputs: (1) the number and locations of fire outbreaks; (2) the firefighting at the initial stages; (3) the weather; (4) the earthquake-related structural damage to buildings; (5) the initial evacuee locations and (6) the obstruction of roads. In this paper, the risk of Kyoto City was evaluated for eight types of inland earthquake to demonstrate the use of the model. As a result, the effectiveness of countermeasures that improve the fire resistance of buildings could be quantified in terms of risk reduction. This result indicates that the method could be an effective tool for disaster prevention. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The General Land Office records of witness trees provide the reference condition for arboreal vegetation, reflect conditions circa 1815-1845, and represent the potential historic vegetation that existed prior to the extensive disturbances caused by European settlement. The data were compiled from surveyor's notes and were linked as a layer to the ArcView geographic information system (GIS) layer for the study area. Nine land types, based on topographic position, slope, and aspect are derived from the GIS. Twenty-eight tree species were identified by common name. Species found in all land types include white oak, black gum, hickory, and red oak. Pines and black oaks are found in all land types but the floodplain. Pines were present in the toe slope adjacent to the floodplain. Four basic indices were produced and are comparable to modern botanical analyses: Relative density: number of times a species occurs out of the total N observations; Basal area: sum of all diameters-species-landtype-landtype association; Relative dominance: total basal area of each species divided by basal area of all species; Importance value: add the relative density of each species to the relative dominance. In the floodplain, three species dominate: white oak (31.6%), black gum (18.4%), and elm (13.2%). The toe slope is adjacent to the floodplain and contains five dominant species: white oak (33.3%), black oak (13.3%), pine (11.1%), black gum (7.7%), and beech (7.7%). The north aspect is divided into three parts: lower, middle, and upper slope. The lower slope is dominated by five species: white oak (43.7%), beech (25%), red oak (6.2%), black oak (6.2%), and pine (6.2%). The middle slope is dominated by five species: white oak (43.8%), black oak (16.9%), pine (10%), hickory (5.8%), and black gum (5.4%). The upper slope is dominated by four species: white oak (45.7%), black oak (14.9%), black gum (10.2%), and pine (7.1%). The south aspect is also divided into lower, middle, and upper slopes. The lower slope is dominated by three species: white oak (29.4%), black oak (23.5%), and pine (20.5%). The middle slope is dominated by five species: white oak (29.3%), pine (28.5%), black oak (17.6%), red oak (4.7%), and black gum (4.4%). The upper slope is dominated by five species: white oak (34.1%), pine (21.5%), black oak (20.5%), red oak (6.8%), and hickory (6.3%), The uplands are characterized by rolling to broken flat ridgetops. These areas are dominated by three species: white oak (43%), black oak (22.9%), and pine (13.8%).

AB  - Truffles are an important food resource for wildlife in North American forests, butdecades of fire exclusion have altered the availability of this resource. In YosemiteNational Park, resource management policies seek to restore essential forestprocesses such as fire while minimizing adverse ecological impacts that may resultfrom burning decades of accumulated fuels. Burning can impact truffles through heatstress, elimination of soil organic layers, and damage to tree hosts, but these effectsmay be dependent on time lags between fires and fire frequency. We examined truffleabundance, and species diversity and composition in four paired burned andunburned sites (8 sites total) in Yosemite to determine the short-term effect of fire ontruffles and its implications for truffle-consuming mammals. Burned and unburned siteshad similar truffle biomass and species richness, but truffle frequency was greater inunburned than burned sites. Truffle species composition was distinctively differentbetween burned and unburned sites, although seven species were found exclusively inboth burned and unburned sites. Truffles were positively associated with litter depth inburned and unburned sites, although this association was stronger in burned sites.Prescribed burning may enhance the regional diversity of truffles for mycophagousmammals across the forest landscape without impacting total abundance in YosemiteNational Park.

AB  - Musically trained subjects tapped three beats with their right hand versus two beats with their left hand in synchrony with two corresponding tones. For independent groups of subjects, the pitch difference of the two tones was either small to encourage an integrated perceptual organization or large to encourage a streamed perceptual organization. Integrated versus parallel motor organization was tested by examining the pattern of covariances among intertap intervals. All subjects exhibited integrated motor organization. An integrated multiplicative hierarchical model of motor organization was superior to a serial chained model and to an independent hierarchical model in describing the pattern of covariances. The subjects who heard tones that encouraged an integrated percept performed with less variability than the subjects who heard tones that encouraged a streamed percept. This superior performance with an integrated motor organization and an integrated rather than a streamed perceptual organization is interpreted as evidence for temporal perceptual-motor compatibility.

AB  - This paper reviews the relationships between land use and climate change. It explores how land use decisions will be affected by future changes in the climate, but also the feedbacks from land use change to the global climate system through greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. Past changes in land use were characterised by decreasing areas of agricultural use and increasing areas of forested and urbanised land. This has led to UK land use being a net sink for GHGs, mostly due to forestation. However, existing forests have on average passed their age for maximum net removals of carbon from the atmosphere. In the next decade at least, net removals from UK forests are likely to decrease significantly.\n\nLonger term scenarios of future land use change are consistent in their expectation of further declines in the agricultural area used for food production – offset to some extent by increased bioenergy cropping – along with increases in forested and urban areas. These trends are broadly consistent with the observed past land use change, but are calculated from various assumptions about future changes in drivers rather than by extrapolation from the past. Socio-economic and technological changes are likely to be the most important drivers for land use, with climate change having a smaller influence. The land use changes represented in these scenarios would likely reduce GHG emissions and enhance carbon sinks. These trends would be reinforced by small future changes in the climate, but large climatic changes are likely to cause net GHG fluxes to switch from being a sink to a source. Land use change will also be moderated by potential policy goals that seek to reduce GHG emissions from land and/or increase the size of land-based sinks. This includes strategies to reduce carbon and nitrogen emissions through increased efficiency, afforestation and biofuel production.

AB  - This article looks at land reform in history and compares it to the present. The primary concern is the relationship between land tenure and economic development, and land reform and the distribution of income, wealth and power. The main finding—that dispersed ownership and management correlate with economic development—is unsurprising. But it is more difficult to assess how conditions which are conducive to maximal production come about, or how a society shifts from concentrated power over land and labour to a dispersed tenure system.

AB  - The European Community's Common Agricultural Policy has helped produce a high degree of stress on the environment. Legislation introduced in the late 1980s reflected a growing awareness of this fact, but a review of the main measures shows that they have merely had minor effects on the results of the support policy in the UK. A new political alignment involving producer and consumer groups and the [`]green' movement is needed to formulate a more environmentally minded approach to agriculture. However, proposals to reduce subsidies will not be successful unless farm businesses can remain profitable.

AB  - Like many old peasant societies, Cyprus has suffered from the fragmentation of landholdings. Beginning in 1969, the government has pursued an active policy of land consolidation. Drawing on the author’s investigation of schemes introduced into five villages between 1969 and 1974, this paper examines the economic, social and psychological effects of the consolidation policy. It is found that as a legislative tool for the reform of Cypriot agrarian structure land consolidation has been a resounding success. There have been rapid economic and social changes, which have generally been welcomed by those affected. It is noted that in the longer term re-fragementation of holdings may occur, and questions arise over the long-term viability of the scheme. However, other Mediterranean countries are encouraged to study the Cypriot experience.

AB  - Soil hydrology was investigated in the Guadelperalon experimental watershed in the title region to determine the influence of land use and vegetation cover on runoff and infiltration within the Dehesa land system. Five soil-vegetation units were selected: (1) tree cover; (2) sheep trials; (3) shrub cover; (4) hillslope grass; and (5) bottom grass. The results of the simulated rainfall experiments performed at an intensity of 53.6 mm h-1 during one hour on plots of 0.25 m2, and the water drop penetration time test indicated the importance of water repellency in the Dehesa land system under drought conditions. Low infiltration rates (9-44 mm h-1) were found everywhere except at shrub sites and in areas with low grazing pressure. Soil water repellency greatly reduced infiltration, especially beneath Quercus ilex canopies, where fast ponding and greater runoff rates were observed. The low vegetation cover as a consequence of a prolonged drought and grazing pressure, in conjunction with the soil water repellency, induced high runoff rates (15-70%). In spite of this, macropore fluxes were found in different locations, beneath trees, on shrub-covered surfaces, as well as at sites with a dominance of herbaceous cover. Discontinuity of the runoff fluxes due to variations in hydrophobicity caused preferential flows and as a consequence deeper infiltration, especially where macropores were developed.

AB  - Current global scale land-change models used for integrated assessments and climate modeling are based on classifications of land cover. However, land-use management intensity and livestock keeping are also important aspects of land use, and are an integrated part of land systems. This article aims to classify, map, and to characterize Land Systems (LS) at a global scale and analyze the spatial determinants of these systems. Besides proposing such a classification, the article tests if global assessments can be based on globally uniform allocation rules. Land cover, livestock, and agricultural intensity data are used to map LS using a hierarchical classification method. Logistic regressions are used to analyze variation in spatial determinants of LS. The analysis of the spatial determinants of LS indicates strong associations between LS and a range of socioeconomic and biophysical indicators of human-environment interactions. The set of identified spatial determinants of a LS differs among regions and scales, especially for (mosaic) cropland systems, grassland systems with livestock, and settlements. (Semi-)Natural LS have more similar spatial determinants across regions and scales. Using LS in global models is expected to result in a more accurate representation of land use capturing important aspects of land systems and land architecture: the variation in land cover and the link between land-use intensity and landscape composition. Because the set of most important spatial determinants of LS varies among regions and scales, land-change models that include the human drivers of land change are best parameterized at sub-global level, where similar biophysical, socioeconomic and cultural conditions prevail in the specific regions.

AB  - Smoke production in the full–scale room fire test ISO 9705 (Commonly referred to as the Room Corner Test) and in the Cone Calorimeter ISO 5660 has been analysed for three sets of building products comprising a total of 28 products. The smoke production may be critical for the fire classification of surface products since some products produce large amounts of smoke in the room fire test even if they do not reach flashover within 20 min. Several smoke parameters in the Cone Calorimeter and the room fire test have been analysed. Good correlations have been obtained when the products are divided into two groups: products with more than 10 min to flashover in the room fire test and those with less than 10 min. These two time categories correspond to the two heat output levels in the room fire test: 100 kW for the first 10 min and then 300 kW up to 20 min. For products with more than 10 min to flashover the average rate of smoke production and the total smoke production seem to be useful parameters for predictions of smoke release in the room fire test. Both parameters have good correlations between data from the Cone Calorimeter and the room fire test. For products with less than 10 min to flashover no parameter seems to give useful predictions. For all products evaluated together, the correlations are not so good, but the same regression lines as for products with more than 10 min might be used as a first rough estimate. In this case the total smoke production in the Cone Calorimeter could be used to estimate the total smoke production in the room fire test for different building products, independent of their estimated time to flashover. It is suggested that the average rate of smoke production and the total smoke production from the Cone Calorimeter is reported in addition to the mass-based specific extinction area. This will be helpful in predicting smoke release in the room fire test and will also make the data on smoke release analogous to those on heat release.

AB  - This review explores the role of land use and land use change as a determinant of the soil's ability to sequester and store carbon in the UK. Over 95 percent of the UK land carbon stock is located in soils which are subjected to a range of land uses and global changes. Land use change can result in rapid soil loss of carbon from peatlands, grasslands, plantation forest and native woodland. Soil carbon accumulates more slowly (decadal) but gains can be made when croplands are converted to grasslands, plantation forest or native woodland. The need for land for food production and renewable forms of energy could have considerable influence on UK soil carbon storage in the future. There is a need to recognise the risk of soil carbon losses occurring when land use change to increase carbon storage is offset by compensatory land use conversions elsewhere that result in net carbon release. The protection of peatland and other organic soil carbon stocks, and the management of cropland, grassland and forest soils to increase carbon sequestration, will be crucial to the maintenance of the UK carbon balance. It will be necessary to develop policy to balance trade-offs between soil carbon gains with other land use priorities. These include the sustainable production of food, bio-energy and fibre crops and livestock, water quality and hydrology, greenhouse gas emission control and waste management, all of which are underpinned by the soil.

AB  - Despite the fact that liquid fuel spills present a potential fire hazard in numerous industrial and residential settings there has been minimal research conducted to understand the spill and burning dynamics of these types of scenarios (Gottuk et al., NRL/MR/6180-00-8457, 2001; Putorti, NIJ-604-00, 2001; Mealy et al., NIJ-2008-DN-BX-K168, 2010; Ma et al., Fire Technol 40:227-246, 2004). While the findings of these studies were significant in that they demonstrated a substantial decrease in the peak fire size achieved in spill fire scenarios compared to pool fires, the empirical data sets collected were not sufficient to fully understand the phenomena causing this reduction. In general, both studies attributed the decrease to thermal losses to the substrate but indicated that further investigation was required. In order to address this general lack of empirical data, a research program was conducted to characterize fuel spill fire dynamics with respect to the key variables that potentially impact these types of fires. A discussion of the test results is presented in two parts: the first being the development of a liquid spill, specifically spill depths and spill progression, and the second being fuel burning dynamics, specifically the impacts of substrate, ignition delay, and substrate temperature. The development of a spill and the associated liquid depths are described for various fuels and fuel simulants, whose properties provide bounding spill scenarios for most fuels of interest. The burning dynamics of various fuel spill scenarios are evaluated relative to numerous substrates, ignition delay times ranging from 30 s to 300 s, and substrate temperatures ranging from 12°C to 38°C (54°F to 100°F). The impact of these variables was evaluated relative to the heat release and mass burning rates measured during these tests. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The multitude of rights in land and the recording of these rights are addressed by a number of studies, yet a recognized paradigm for such studies seems missing. Rights in land are recorded and managed through either cadastral systems or land administration systems depending on the legal system of the countries concerned. The cadastre, however, is the core of both systems as it provides for systematic and official descriptions of land parcels or real property units. The research mentioned often has a development perspective, and in this article we will motivate the introduction of the research domain of cadastral development. This research is multi-disciplinary and draws on elements of theories and methodologies fromthe natural, the social, the behavioral, and the formal sciences. During the last decade or so, doctoral dissertations have come to constitute a substantial part of this research effort. The article focuses on the methodological aspect of doctoral research by analyzing ten doctoral dissertations. Our analysis is based on a taxonomy ofmethodological elements and aims at identifying commonalities and differences among the dissertations in the use of concepts andmethods. Having completed the main analysis,we invited the authors of the dissertations to comment upon our analysis of their work and the developed taxonomy. The responses corroborate the viewthat the taxonomy could be used for further analyses and provide for a framework for further doctoral research. The article concludes with a call for a shared terminology and a shared set of concepts whichmay contribute to further theory building within the cadastral domain.

AB  - The need to enhance sustainable development of land use is more urgent than ever; specifically in developing countries where poverty and land degradation are often interlinked. To promote a common understanding of land use problems by experts, stakeholders and decision makers, it is essential to understand the system characteristics, including the complex feedbacks between drivers and impacts. To enhance sustainable development, appropriate policies need to be identified. In this paper, we analysed and compared seven case studies in Kenya, Mali, Tunisia, China, India, Indonesia and Brazil, representing different biophysical and socio-economic conditions and challenges. We analysed Driver Pressure State Impact Response (DPSIR) story lines of the land use problems, policy priorities and value trade-offs as identified by stakeholders and experts in National Policy Forums. Important drivers of land use change impacting main land use problems among the case studies were economic growth, technological development, immigration and agricultural intensification, in addition to existing policies. Of the latter the most important were related to domestic support through various forms of subsidies or access to credit, land tenure polices and liberalization policies. In the policy prioritization, the value trade-offs made by the National Policy Forums emphasize the environment rather than increased economic production. It is recognized that the environment needs to be improved to maintain and improve economic production in the long term, both in agriculture and in other sectors. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic methodology to derive land-use classes from a remotely sensed data derived land cover map at a scale of 1:200,000. The aim of the study is to better understand the land cover/land-use relationship and to enhance the value of a land cover mapping product for the planning and management of natural resources and/or environmental change studies. In the case of the study, the land cover product is generated using the {FAO/UNEP} "land cover classification system". The methodology is heavily determined by the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery, the classification system used and the expert knowledge of the study area. For any given land cover the associated land-uses are identified as well as the land cover/land-use relationship. It is assumed that these relations can be of four types: one to one, one to many, many to one or a combination of any of the aforementioned possibilities. The land cover/land-use relation need not be consistent across the study area. The parameters used for land-use classification are based on a comprehensive review of the literature, in which land cover and land-use are usually amalgamated. A set of decision rules was established to define land-use classes. These decision rules were tested during the field survey, after which they were applied to the whole study area. The concurrence of land cover and land-use delineations is discussed for the classes identified. The result of the study is a detailed, flexible land-use data set in which the various parameters used for classification can be re-grouped according to user needs.

AB  - This paper is concerned with the structural and cultural characteristics of research organizations which influence the making of major discoveries in twentieth-century bio-medical sciences, especially characteristics of research organizations which repeatedly make major discoveries across time. Although most of the empirical analysis for these findings is based on research organizations in the United States, we also make some reference to research organizations in other nations. This paper is part of a larger study involving structural and cultural characteristics of bio-medical research organizations in four countries. Why do research organizations vary in their capacities to make major discoveries in biomedical science? Science, especially in the twentieth century, has been very dynamic and has grown in unpredictable ways. Because most research organizations experience considerable inertia and change rather slowly, they have considerable difficulty in adapting to the fast pace of scientific and technological change. Time and time again, a research organization has been a world class leader in an area of science, but because of organizational inertia and failure to adapt to new trends, it has lost its leading edge. This paper argues that organizations require distinctive structural and cultural characteristics if its scientists are to make major discoveries repeatedly. It is to the identification of these characteristics that this research is addressed. The questions posed in this research have their bases in the sociological literature concerned with how the structural and cultural characteristics of organizations influence the making of radical innovations. There is a vast and excellent literature in the history and sociology of modern science about performance in the scientific community e.g., scientific discovery, the creative process, and more generally, scientific productivity (Ben-David 1960, 1971, 1977; Merton 1961; Pelz and Andrews 1966; Zuckerman 1977; Allen 1978a,b; Olby 1979; Fox 1983; Allison and Long 1990; Shapin 1995), and about the organizational contexts within which science occurs (Lynch 1985, 1993; Shapin 1995). In recent years, an increasing number of studies (Latour and Woolgar 1979; Fujimura 1987; Latour 1987; Shapin 1995; Rheinberger 1997) has focused on the importance of the research lab/department as the site of discoveries. These and other studies have emphasized the importance of tacit knowledge and have demonstrated that knowledge is highly differentiated, unequally distributed, and richly sited in local contexts (Lynch 1985, 1993; Polanyi 1966; Dasgupta and David 1993;). Whereas much of the recent literature has focused on the research setting of a single organization, this paper differs in being more comparative and historical in nature. It specifies a series of research organization and laboratory and/or department level variables and then uses brief case studies to analyze the pattern of relationships among these variables, especially as they relate to the making of major discoveries in bio-medical science.

AB  - Problem: Since the late 1980s, U.S. metropolitan regions have increasingly engaged in a style of land use-transportation scenario planning that merges techniques borrowed from military and business strategic planning with long-range transportation systems planning and project-level alternatives analysis. Aside from occasional anecdotal descriptions, the effectiveness of such approaches in generating compact growth plans has not been evaluated comprehensively. Purpose: We analyzed a wide range of scenario planning studies to determine how far compact growth scenarios are predicted to reduce vehicular travel below existing trends. Methods: Using hierarchical modeling, we developed a regional vehicle-miles-traveled (VMT) model based on 85 scenarios in 23 planning studies from 18 metropolitan areas. Results and conclusions: Using coefficients from this model, we conservatively estimate that compact growth scenarios reduce VMT in 2050 by 17% below scenarios assuming a continuation of existing trends. Takeaway for practice: Existing transportation models remain largely insensitive to changes in land use and transportation policy. This must change for scenario planning to achieve its full potential. In the future, scenario planning should incorporate the best current knowledge about how global economic and environmental trends will affect regions. Research support: Collection of the primary data used in this article was funded in part by the Federal Highway Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, under Cooperative Agreement No. DTFH61-03-H-00134.

AB  - The reports of Montano Complex fire as an urban structural firefighting and complicated interface event are discussed. The cause for Montano Complex fire was the cooking fire left unattended by an urban outdoorman which caused three containers of cooking propane to explode. The Montano Complex comes under the Bosque, a wildland urban interface comprising the riverbanks and the surrounding vegetation of the Rio Grande river. The reduced flooding and the nonnative overgrowth in the Bosque fire environment combined to produce a fuel loading that presents extreme fire potential and unacceptable firefigther risk during a fire. Various other factors such as climatic conditions, accessibility and command considerations are also mentioned.

AB  - A combined transportation-land use model is proposed in this paper. Unlike other existing urban land use and transportation planning models in which a â€œfixed demandâ€  for services is assumed to be known at the zonal level of an urban area, zonal travel demand is endogenously determined together with link congestion costs, optimal amounts of production and resulting efficient densities of land uses, once the transportation network is given. Some characteristics of alternative solutions are demonstrated. The proposed model represents progress over previous efforts in combining land use-transportation problems since the travel choice as to origin, destination and routes as well as amounts of goods to be produced at the optimal density of land uses are integrated into a consistent mathematical programming framework.

AB  - The role of land tenure in agricultural development has been a subject of intensive research, particularly within the context of land and agrarian reform. The complexity of the world's major land tenure systems is well recognized and no attempt is made here to go beyond an overview as this paper limits itself to the impact of land tenure on land use in low income situations. Present land use is determined by a host of factors, of a physical/biological and socioeconomic nature. In applying land evaluation, the question it is necessary to ask is to what extent, when and where land tenure conditions act as a considerable constraining factor impeding a more optimal use of land resources. Even in what used to be low-population density areas (such as Sub-Saharan Africa) it appears that the frontier phase is becoming exhausted and the intensification of agriculture proceeds; it becomes imperative to examine land tenure in relation to land use implications. It is shown that so far a multi-disciplinary approach has often been lacking in treating land tenure and related issues.

AB  - A virtual laboratory is a virtual space where students are able to carry out practical activities. This paper presents an integrated structure for a virtual laboratory consisting on nine resources divided into pedagogical, human, and technological factors. Such a structure is based on the experience gained in design and development of virtual laboratories during the past 11 years in a virtual university. The proposed structure has been applied to different virtual laboratories, and this paper presents the special case of a virtual networking laboratory (VNLab) where students can access real networking devices. The VNLab structure described in this paper has been used at the Open University of Catalonia for the Cisco Networking Academic since 2001. Its suitability has been evaluated by the students using a Web questionnaire, and its correctness for the industrial electronics field has been analyzed.

AB  - In a PCR of cDNA using myo-3 (antisense) and SL2 (sense) primers ( SL2=splice leader 2; Huang and Hirsh WBG 10 #3 p79) we obtained a prominent band under moderate stringency cDNA synthesis conditions. When we cloned and sequenced this band we found no homology to myo-3 but rather a sequence which encodes a ribosomal protein homologue. The initial SL2 oligo contained only the first 17 bases of the 22bp leader. The presence of the other 5 nucleotides of SL2 in the cDNA clones confirms that SL2 was indeed present on the 5' end of the gene. No equivalent band was found when a similar SL1 oligo was used as primer. [See Figure 1]

AB  - This paper reports on the culmination of a two year project to facilitate “smart growth” planning in the Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area. Using a group model building process, representatives of key municipal entities and resource management agencies developed a model for examining the potential effects of changes in land use and transportation planning on air quality, traffic congestion, and other quality of life factors. The model and the process both contributed significantly to broadening systems thinking capacity in regional planning. The model supports system-based policy evaluation and the process created a common systems language among the more than 20 land use, transportation, and air quality planners in the group. The model represents regional links between population, transportation infrastructure, land use characteristics, and air pollution. Model analysis shows that the most powerful tool for achieving policy objectives is a combination of land use design and transportation infrastructure that reduces the average number of trips per day and distance per trip. This paper describes the model, results of the analysis, and effects of the group model building process on the participants.

AB  - Over the last decades there has been intense focus on better understanding land-use-transportation relationships. One prominent research area within this nexus has examined whether urban structural characteristics, such as the balance of jobs and housing, impacts broader transportation patterns, particularly commuting outcomes. Researchers have sought to quantify relationships in comparative studies across space and time, without fully realizing the latter due to sparse data availability, mainly due to reliance on government census type products which often lack adequate temporal resolution. This research utilizes a relatively new database from the U.S. Census known as Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) to explore temporal commuting-land-use relationships. This database has a high degree of spatial and temporal resolution, with worker information reported annually from 2002 to 2010. Locations of workers, jobs, and their commute flows are resolved to the census block scale. We analyze LEHD data over a 9-year period from 2002 to 2010 for a mid-sized urban area. Estimation of several commuting and jobs-housing metrics lends insights into growth and decline that have occurred in the recent housing boom and bust, and their broader implications for travel patterns. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Four large-scale fire tests have been carried out with heavy goods vehicle (HGV) cargos in the Runehamar tunnel in Norway. During two of the fire tests, large pulsations of the gas flow inside the tunnel were observed. These pulsations were registered only when the measured HRR was higher than 125-135 MW. Two different periods of pulsations were registered, short periods of approximately 4 s and longer periods of approximately 18 s. In the article, the pulsations are presented and explanations are given, using a frequency response analysis based on an impedance approach. Using this approach, the authors were able to find the intrinsic resonances of the system, which were close to the periods of 4 and 18 s found in the experiments. Several factors can affect the pulsations, but the calculations show that the oscillation periods are properties of the system. The analyses show further that at certain frequencies (close to those found during the tests), a small disturbance in the flow can create large amplitudes in the pressure. It is proposed that this phenomenon should be studied in conjunction with future full scale tunnel tests. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper was presented at the conference &#8216;Integrating spatial technologies and ecological principles for a new age in fire management&#8217;, Boise, Idaho, USA, June 1999. Maps of fire frequency, severity, size, and pattern are useful for strategically planning fire and natural resource management, assessing risk and ecological conditions, illustrating change in disturbance regimes through time, identifying knowledge gaps, and learning how climate, topography, vegetation, and land use influence fire regimes. We review and compare alternative data sources and approaches for mapping fire regimes at national, regional, and local spatial scales. Fire regimes, defined here as the nature of fires occurring over an extended period of time, are closely related to local site productivity and topography, but climate variability entrains fire regimes at regional to national scales. In response to fire exclusion policies, land use, and invasion of exotic plants over the last century, fire regimes have changed greatly, especially in dry forests, woodlands, and grasslands. Comparing among and within geographic regions, and across time, is a powerful way to understand the factors determining and constraining fire patterns. Assembling spatial databases of fire information using consistent protocols and standards will aid comparison between studies, and speed and strengthen analyses. Combining multiple types of data will increase the power and reliability of interpretations. Testing hypotheses about relationships between fire, climate, vegetation, land use, and topography will help to identify what determines fire regimes at multiple scales.

AB  - In the USA 857 private local and regional conservation groups known as landtrusts have protected some 2 million acres of ecologically or scenically important land from incompatible development using voluntary compensating techniques such as conservation easements. Landtrust members often see their actions as an alternative to government regulatory planning. This article looks at the history organization and activities of landtrusts and analyses the assets and liabilities of a voluntary approach. Grassroots landtrusts are viewed as a highly successful statement of vernacular land policy warranting far greater use by land use planners and development strategists throughout the world.

AB  - An increased frequency of droughts is predicted for the Amazon\nrainforest in the 21st century, which, combined with deforestation,\ncould exacerbate fire occurrence in the region. There is ample evidence\nof the association between fire use and deforestation in the land use\nand land cover change (LULCC) processes occurring in the Amazon region,\nbut there are no studies on the actual spatial structuring and spatial\nassociation between these events. The present study evaluates the\nexistence of such relationships through the use of remotely sensed data\nand spatial analysis techniques for an active deforestation frontier\ncovering portions of the states of Rondonia and Mato Grosso in the\nBrazilian Amazon. A map of burn scars for the year 2005 was produced\nusing a Linear Spectral Mixture Model (LSMM) transformation of Landsat\nThematic Mapper (TM) images, with subsequent unsupervised classification\nand manual editing. Annual and aggregated maps of deforested areas up to\n2005, produced by the Brazilian Amazon Deforestation Estimation Project\n(PRODES), were also used. The amount of burn scar occurrences inside\nboth recent (2002-2005) and old (prior to 2002) deforested areas was\nthen determined, and the spatial structure of both variables was\nassessed using Mantel tests for multiple aggregation scales. A partial\nMantel test was also used to test the spatial correlation between burn\nscars and deforested areas, accounting for the existence of spatial\nstructure. The results show that there is a significant spatial\nassociation between recent deforestation and the occurrence of fires. In\naddition, we identified a large amount of burned areas (similar to 55%)\nwithin older deforested areas. These results highlight the following: 1)\nthe direct role of fire in the land use and land cover change processes\nin the Brazilian Amazon, and 2) that fire also widely affects previously\ndegraded vegetation, with significant implications for current estimates\nof forest fire-associated atmospheric carbon emission in the Amazon\nregion.

AB  - Many countries have adopted agrarian reform programmes which distinguish between the intensification of farming through technical change and land reform. Yet both come within agrarian reform and they should be seen as complementary to each other rather than as alternatives. This article addresses the implications of Turkish agrarian reform for the Southeast Anatolia Project (GAP). GAP is the fourth largest irrigation project In the world and its long-term objective is to reduce regional disparity by developing the Southeast. The agrarian structure of Southeast Anatolia and the government's past and present policies towards agriculture may Influence GAP's potential success.

AB  - Land use is a key driver of global environmental change. Unless major shifts in consumptive behaviours occur, land-based production will have to increase drastically to meet future demands for food and other commodities. One approach to better understand the drivers and impacts of agricultural intensification is the identification of global, archetypical patterns of land systems. Current approaches focus on broad-scale representations of dominant land cover with limited consideration of land-use intensity. In this study, we derived a new global representation of land systems based on more than 30 high-resolution datasets on land-use intensity, environmental conditions and socioeconomic indicators. Using a self-organizing map algorithm, we identified and mapped twelve archetypes of land systems for the year 2005. Our analysis reveals similarities in land systems across the globe but the diverse pattern at sub-national scales implies that there are no 'one-size-fits-all' solutions to sustainable land management. Our results help to identify generic patterns of land pressures and environmental threats and provide means to target regionalized strategies to cope with the challenges of global change. Mapping global archetypes of land systems represents a first step towards better understanding the global patterns of human-environment interactions and the environmental and social outcomes of land system dynamics. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The anaphylatoxin C3a and its inactivated derivative C3adesArg, generated during complement activation, exert direct antimicrobial effects, mediated via its C-terminal region [Nordahl et al. (2004) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 101, 16879-16884]. During evolution, this region of C3a displays subtle changes in net charge, while preserving a moderate but variable amphipathicity [Pasupuleti et al. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 2520-2528]. In this study, we mimic these evolutionary changes, employing a design approach utilizing selected amino acid substitutions at strategic and structurally relevant positions in the original human C3a peptide CNYITELRRQHARASHLGLA, followed by structure-activity studies incorporating sequence-dependent QSAR models as tools for generation of C3a peptide variants with enhanced effects. While the native peptide and related amphipathic analogues of moderate positive net charge were active against the Gram-negative Escherichia coli, activity against the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus was primarily observed for peptides characterized by a combination of a relatively high net charge (+6-7) and a propensity to adopt an alpha-helical conformation with amphipathic character. Such increased helicity and charge also conferred activity against the fungus Candida albicans. A central histidine residue (H11), evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates, conferred high selectivity toward microbes, while substitutions with leucine rendered the peptides hemolytic. Selected C3a analogues retained their specificity against staphylococci in the presence of human plasma, while showing low cytotoxicity. The work illustrates structure-activity relationships underlying the function and specificity of antimicrobial C3a and related analogues and provides insights into the forces that drive evolution of antimicrobial peptides.

AB  - This paper aims to describe an alternative fire growth model that allows prediction of fire development, including time to flashover. The unpredictable nature of real fire development is incorporated into the model through use of probability distributions which can be defined using appropriate fire test data, when available. By assuming that the fire goes through five different stages starting from ignition and progressing to flashover, the total time to flashover may also be estimated. The model considers potential variability in the times at which the fire will undergo transitions between the various stages of development, using a state transition method called the semi-Markov process model. Different fire data may be incorporated into the model by defining appropriate statistical distributions for the transition descriptors, making the model flexible enough for use in a variety of applications important to both product design engineers and fire safety regulators.

AB  - Recent ex-urban development within the wildland interface has significantly increased the complexity and associated cost of federal wildland fire management in the United States. Rapid identification of built structures relative to probable fire spread can help to reduce that complexity and improve the performance of incident management teams. Approximate structure locations can be mapped as specific-point building cluster features using cadastral data records. This study assesses the accuracy and precision of building clusters relative to GPS structure locations and compares these results with area mapping of housing density using census-based products. We demonstrate that building clusters are reasonably accurate and precise approximations of structure locations and provide superior strategic information for wildland fire decision support compared with area density techniques. Real-time delivery of structure locations and other values-at-risk mapped relative to probable fire spread through the Wildland Fire Decision Support System Rapid Assessment of Values at Risk procedure supports development of wildland fire management strategies. © IAWF 2011.

AB  - The main aim of this paper is to extend the cases of WFDS model validation by comparing its predictions to literature data on a ground fire spreading in a Pinus pinaster needles fuel bed. This comparison is based on the experimental results of Mendes-Lopes and co-workers. This study is performed using the same domain as in the experiments (3.0m1.2m0.9m) with a mesh of 49,280 cells. We investigate the influence of wind (varied between 0 and 2 m/s) and moisture content (10 and 18%) on the rate of spread. The WFDS rate of spread is determined using a cross-correlation function of ground temperature profiles. The obtained results of rate of spread as well as temperature compared favourably to experimental values and show the WFDS model capacity to predict ground fires in Pinus Pinaster fuel beds.

AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado, a biodiverse savanna ecoregion covering ???1.8 million km2 south and east of the Amazon rainforest, is in rapid decline because of the expansion of modern agriculture. Previous studies of Cerrado land-use and land-cover (LULC) change imply spatial homogeneity, report widely varying rates of land conversion, use ambiguous LULC categories, and generally do not attempt to validate results. This study addresses this gap in the literature by analyzing moderate-resolution, multi-spectral satellite remote sensing data from 1986 to 2002 in two regions with identical underlying drivers. Unsupervised classification by the ISODATA algorithm indicates that Cerrado was converted to agro-pastoral land covers in 31% (3646 km2) of the study region in western Bahia and 24% (3011 km2) of the eastern Mato Grosso study region, while nearly 40% (4688 km2 and 5217 km2, respectively) of each study region remained unchanged. Although aggregate land change is similar, large and contiguous fragments persist in western Bahia, while smaller fragments remain in eastern Mato Grosso. These findings are considered in the current context of Cerrado land-use policy, which is dominated by the conservation set-aside and command-control policy models. The spatial characteristics of Cerrado remnants create considerable obstacles to implement the models; an alternative approach, informed by countryside biogeography, may encourage collaboration between state officials and farmer-landowners toward conservation land-use policies. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Collectively, landscape structure, fuel loading, and weather control wildland fires. Our objective was to examine the impacts of landscape structure, weather and fire-ignition location on fire spread using FARSITE. We simulated surface fires in the Chequamegon National Forest, Wisconsin, on five landscapes: a control and four harvested landscapes created using HARVEST by varying the amount (2% and 4%) and method of harvesting (i.e., clustered and dispersed), labeled C2, C4, D2, and D4. We applied three levels of precipitation and wind speed to examine weather influences. We found that fire-ignition location had the strongest effect on fire spread, followed by rain. The high-rain scenario (twice the actual rainfall) decreased burned area by an average of 241 ha (6.1%) for simulated 15-day surface fires, whereas the low-rain scenario (half of actual rainfall) increased burned area by an average of 74 ha (1.8%). The maximum size of burned area decreased in all harvest scenarios by 90 ha (1.6%), 143 ha (2.6%), 168 ha (3.1%), and 201 ha (3.7%), respectively, for landscapes D2, C2, D4, and C4. We concluded that management at the ignition location is critical and landscape-level management may be adapted to influence landscape predisposition to fire spread.

AB  - Accidental hypothermia is an infrequent and under-diagnosed pathology, which causes fatalities every year. Its management requires thermometers to measure core temperature. An esophageal probe may be used in a hospital situation, although in moderate hypothermia victims epitympanic measurement is sufficient. Initial management involves advance life support and body rewarming. Vigorous movements can trigger arrhythmia which does not use to respond to medication or defibrillation until the body reaches 30C. External, passive rewarming is the method of choice for mild hypothermia and a supplementary method for moderate or severe hypothermia. Active external rewarming is indicated for moderate or severe hypothermia or mild hypothermia that has not responded to passive rewarming. Active internal rewarming is indicated for hemodynamically stable patients suffering moderate or severe hypothermia. Patients with severe hypothermia, cardiac arrest or with a potassium level below 12 mmol/l may require cardiopulmonary bypass treatment. Copyright  2010 Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

Its impact on soil often occurs so creepingly that land managers hardly contemplate initiating ameliorative or counterbalance measures. Poor land management has degraded vast amounts of land, reduced our ability to produce enough food, and is a major threat to rural livelihoods in many developing countries. To date, there has been no single unifying volume that addresses the multifaceted impacts of land use on soils. This book has responded to this challenge by bringing together renowned academics and policy experts to analyze the patterns, driving factors and proximate causes, and the socioeconomic impacts of soil degradation. Policy measures to prevent irreversible degradation and rehabilitate degraded soils are also identified.

AB  - Fire and explosion are accidents which potentially can occur in oil and gas processing facilities. While fire and explosion could occur as a consequence of each other, most published work has assessed fire and explosion separately, ignoring interactions between the two phenomena. The current study proposes a novel approach to model the entire sequences involved in a potential accident using liquid and gas release incidents as two test cases. The integrated scenario is modelled using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes FLACS and FDS. An integrated approach is adopted to analyse and represent the effects (injuries/death) of the accident. The proposed approach can be used in designing safety measures to minimize the adverse impacts of such accidents. It can also serve as an important tool to develop safety training to improve emergency preparedness plans. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fire response procedures describe what actions an operator may need to perform in order to ensure a credited path exists for safe shutdown. These procedures are not typically written to mimic existing Emergency Operating Procedures (EOP) and may be written as a guidance document. In many cases, the equipment that is credited for the safe shutdown path in fire areas is not listed along with instrumentation that may be needed in order to confirm proper equipment operation. Actions contained within the procedure are also not ordered such that time sensitive actions may not be performed before other actions that have a much longer time frame. With these shortcomings in mind, calculation of an acceptable fire response Human Failure Event (HFE) is very challenging A method to remove these shortcomings is to re-write the fire response procedures into a format with which operators are more familiar. Fire response procedures can be re-written to mimic the current Pressurized Water Reactor two column format such that these documents can then be used to supply cues and definitive instructions as to what actions to perform to reduce the impact of fire induced failures, or to recover failed equipment. Instrumentation can also be specified so operators will know what instruments may be available for diagnosis and recovery. The equipment that is credited to satisfy the various safe shutdown functions such as Reactor Coolant System (RCS) Inventory Control, or AC power can be listed. The needed operator actions can also be ordered such that time critical actions are performed first. Recovery steps can also be provided to ensure equipment is operating correctly after performance of a fire response action.

AB  - Biological invasion and fire-caused disturbances are both natural processes in tropical–subtropical ecosystems. The 2 processes are often interrelated in a complex manner. This will be discussed in relation to the major zonal and intra-zonal tropical biomes, which adjoin each other along climatic and edaphic gradients. Atmospheric change and weather disturbances can promote fire via biological invasion associated with fuel loading. Stand-level demography may also play a major role. In the tropics, pyrophytic C4 grasses are quick to invade following logging and slash-burning, even in wet rain forests. This appears to be an important difference compared with temperate zone forest biomes. Human activity has contributed to biological invasion in a profound way, particularly in formerly isolated tropical environments with underutilized resource capacities. This has often led to environmental degradation. However, improved understanding of natural processes of vegetation dynamics can help to counteract environmental degradation through appro- priate restoration measures.

AB  - Two series of 16 and 18 laboratory fire experiments were conducted to explore the respective roles of radiation and convection heat transfer in slope effect on fire spread. The first series attempts to measure fuel temperature and gas temperature simultaneously and at the same location using an infrared camera and thermocouples respectively. The second series measures the incident radiant heat flux as would be received by a small fuel bed volume ahead of the fire line. These measurements are used to compute a fuel bed heat balance for each slope angle (0 degrees, 10 degrees, 20 degrees and 30 degrees). Overall, radiative heating is found to be the heat transfer mechanism that dominates in the slope effect between 0 degrees and 20 degrees, but close to the fire line (<10 cm), the flux due to convective heating is also significant, reaching one-third of the net heat flux at a 20 degrees slope angle. When the slope angle increases from 20 degrees to 30 degrees, the rate of spread rises by a factor of 2.5 due to a marked increase in convective heating, while radiative heating no longer increases. Far from the fire line, cooling by convection is found to be substantial except at the 30 degrees slope angle.

AB  - Rural residential development can impact habitat and complicate fire management. Conservation easements are created to prevent development but are rarely assessed for their influence on development patterns. In the Lassen Foothills, California, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) holds over 37,000 ha of mostly public-funded conservation easements on ranchland dominated by blue oak (Quercus douglasii) woodland. For this region we modeled land use through 2050 under two scenarios, with and without conservation easements, using a rule-based growth model. We mapped development footprints on 760 rural residential parcels through automated remote sensing. From calculated footprint sizes we projected site-level habitat loss for each scenario. We also projected the influence of development patterns on fire management. With easements present the Lassen Foothills would gain about 184 new homes, compared with 223 homes if easements were absent. With an average residential footprint size of 0.34 ?? 0.25 ha (mean ?? SD), we found that easements slightly reduce vegetation conversion, protecting an additional 16.8 ha than were protected by the general plan alone. Without easements, scattered development may alter fire management on 12,370 ha (17.5% of undeveloped wildfire containment areas) by requiring more fire suppression and reducing options for prescribed burning. Low development pressure and county land use policies maintain very low residential densities in the Lassen Foothills. The easement program may increase options for fire management by preserving large landscapes. This case illustrates the limited effectiveness of land acquisition in preventing development in a low-threat landscape, and demonstrates the utility of growth models for prioritizing conservation investments.

AB  - Currently there are no internationally accepted methodologies to evaluate and compare the performance of land administration systems. This is partly because land administration systems are in constant reform, and probably more importantly, they represent societies’ different perceptions of land. This paper describes the development of a framework to measure and compare the performance of land administration systems. The research is of particular relevance since it develops a management model which links the operational aspects of land administration with land policy.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic methodology to derive land-use classes from a remotely sensed data derived land cover map at a scale of 1:200,000. The aimof the study is to better understand the land cover/land-use relationship and to enhance the value of a land cover mapping product for the planning and management of natural resources and/or environmental change studies. In the case of the study, the land cover product is generated using the FAO/UNEP ‘‘land cover classification system’’. The methodology is heavily determined by the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery, the classification system used and the expert knowledge of the study area. For any given land cover the associated land-uses are identified as well as the land cover/land-use relationship. It is assumed that these relations can be of four types: one to one, one to many, many to one or a combination of any of the aforementioned possibilities. The land cover/land-use relation need not be consistent across the study area. The parameters used for land-use classification are based on a comprehensive review of the literature, in which land cover and land-use are usually amalgamated. A set of decision rules was established to define land-use classes. These decision rules were tested during the field survey, after which they were applied to the whole study area. The concurrence of land cover and land-use delineations is discussed for the classes identified. The result of the study is a detailed, flexible land-use data set in which the various parameters used for classification can be re-grouped according to user needs.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of shrimp farming on rice ecosystem in a village in Southwestern Bangladesh. The village Damarpota has experienced transformation of 274&#xa0;ha (79%) of its prime quality rice fields into shrimp farms during the period between 1985 and 2003. Prolonged shrimp farming for 5-, 10-, and 15-year period has increased soil salinity, acidity, and depleted soil Ca, K, Mg, and organic C content of all three types of soils in the villages to a variable degree and caused soil degradation that significantly affected the rice yield. Declined yield and acreage of rice jointly reduced the total production of rice and animal fodder. Soil degradation and loss of acreage under rice have threatened the sustainability of the village rice ecosystem.

AB  - The objective is to assess the ability of land use transportation models to address some current policy issues. The nature of the relationship between land use and transportation is examined briefly in terms of empirical evidence and the results from modeling exercises. Two studies that the use of such models and that are being carried out in Britain are examined. Despite these and some convincing arguments by expers, there is little evidence of widespread use of such models. A number of current policy issues are discussed, and then a set of policy instruments that can be used to meet the policy objectives are identified. Evidence on the ability of land use transportation models to represent the impacts of the policy instruments is presented. It is shown how such models can contribute significantly in some areas of policy analsys, for example, reducing congestion and energy use, but can contribute very little to the objective of moving toward a market economy.

AB  - Models of wildfire threat are often used in the management of fire-prone areas for purposes such as planning fire education campaigns and the deployment of fire prevention and suppression resources. While the use of spatial or geographic data is common to all wildfire threat models, the key question arises: Is the accuracy of the spatial data used in wildfire threat models sufficient for the intended decision-making purpose? To help answer this question, a quantitative uncertainty assessment technique was applied to a wildfire threat model used by the Country Fire Authority in Victoria, Australia. The technique simulates known or estimated spatial data error by modifying data values to represent the range of all probable errors present in the input dataset. The wildfire threat model is then run multiple times using these modified 'error' layers in order to simulate and observe the effect these errors have on the model outputs. For the model concerned, the results suggest that errors in digital elevation surfaces have only minimal impact upon the outputs, resulting in relatively stable wildfire management decisions. On the other hand inaccuracies in land cover maps (with implied differences in fuel load estimations) result in larger changes in the model outputs, whereas changes in fire weather data can result in highly unstable outputs. Knowledge of these effects can facilitate better wildfire management since any improvements that are to be made to the model's accuracy can be focussed directly upon the problem datasets.

AB  - Since the 19th century, Danish policies regarding land use in the wider countryside have been strongly influenced by two competing policy networks. In the period 1866-1970, a strong 'land reclamation network' was privileged at the expense of a weak 'nature protection network'. In contrast, during the last couple of decades, the situation has been turned on its head. Here, a strong nature protection network has been privileged at the expense of a weaker 'land reclamation network'. In each of the above stable periods, however, a detailed case study of decision-making regarding a rejected project shows that sometimes the weaker network is able to defeat a stronger network in relation to concrete project decisions regarding the use of water bodies. Why is it that even very strong policy communities cannot expect to have all projects they support implemented? Adding the concepts of policy venue and policy image [Baumgartner, F.R., Jones, B.D., 1993. Agendas and Instability in American Politics. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London] to the rather static policy network approach provides an explanation-a theoretical framework which, for example, can be applied to decisions/non-decisions regarding nature restoration projects in those countries who during recent years have been trying to move beyond water body protection to restoration of water bodies to their natural state. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Wildland fi re use as a concept had its origin when humans fi rst gained the ability to suppress fi res. Some fi res were suppressed and others were allowed to burn based on human values and objectives. Native Americans and Euro-American settlers fought those fi res that threatened their villages and settlements but left others to burn unabated. Even with the advent of a fi re suppression capability in the late 1880s, control efforts were focused on areas of human development while fi res in remote areas were largely ignored. When the Forest Service was established in 1905, fi re suppression became its reason for being, although some foresters questioned the economic logic of suppressing all fi res. Fire suppression was the only fi re policy for all federal land management agencies until the late 1960s when the National Park Service offi cially recognized fi re as a natural process. Lightning fi res ignited in special management zones in parks were allowed to run their course under prescribed conditions. The Forest Service followed suit in 1974 and changed its policy from fi re control to fi re management, allowing lightning fi res to burn in wilderness areas. The programs in both agencies grew slowly as managers became comfortable with allowing fi res to burn under controlled conditions. Various terms were used to describe these programs including “Let Burn,” “Prescribed Natural Fire,” and now “Wildland Fire Use.” Setbacks such as the Yellowstone fi res in 1988 and the Cerro Grande fi re in 2000 resulted in reviews and updates of federal fi re management policies. The Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Bureau of Indian Affairs joined the other two agencies by implementing fi re use programs in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Today wildland fi re use is a vital link in the fi re and fuels programs of each of the federal land management agencies with nearly 6,000 fi res burning over 1,400,000 ha (3,500,000 ac) annually. The future of restoring fi re to fi re-prone ecosystems will have to rely on increasing the use of wildland fi re. Keywords:

AB  - Rapid industrialization and urbanization in China has produced a unique phenomenon of 'village-hollowing', shaped by the dual-track structure of socio-economic development. This paper analyzes the phenomenon of 'village-hollowing', identifying the processes and influences that have driven their evolution, and highlighting the challenge that the locking-up of unused rural housing land in 'hollowed villages' presents for China in the context of concerns over urban development and food security. The paper examines the 'increasing vs. decreasing balance' land-use policy has been adopted by the Chinese government in response to the problem, which seeks to balance increases in urban construction land with a reduction in rural construction land. The implementation of the scheme is discussed through a case study of Huantai county in Shandong province, drawing attention to its contested and contingent nature. It is argued that the policy is a top-down approach to rural restructuring that necessarily requires the acquiescence of local actors. However, it is noted that failures to adequate engage with local actors has led to resistance to the policy, including violent protests against the demolition of housing. The paper suggests that lessons might be learned from Europe by incorporating elements of 'bottom-up' planning into the process. As such, the paper demonstrates that rural restructuring in China is a dynamic, multi-scalar and hybrid process that shares common elements and experiences with rural restructuring in Europe and elsewhere, but which is also strongly shaped by the distinctive political, economic, social and cultural context of China. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVES-To evaluate integrated care for diabetes in clinical, psychosocial, and economic terms. DESIGN-Pragmatic randomised trial. SETTING-Hospital diabetic clinic and three general practice groups in Grampian. PATIENTS-274 adult diabetic patients attending a hospital clinic and registered with one of three general practices. INTERVENTION-Random allocation to conventional hospital clinic care or integrated care. Integrated care patients seen in general practice every three or four months and in the hospital clinic annually. General practitioners were given written guidelines for integrated care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES-Metabolic control, psychosocial status, knowledge of diabetes, beliefs about control of diabetes, satisfaction with treatment, disruption of normal activities, numbers of consultations and admissions, frequency of metabolic monitoring, costs to patients and NHS. RESULTS-A higher proportion of patients defaulted from conventional care (14 (10%)) than from integrated care (4 (3%), 95% confidence interval of difference 2% to 13%). After two years no significant differences were found between the groups in metabolic control, psychosocial status, knowledge, beliefs about control, satisfaction with treatment, unscheduled admissions, or disruption of normal activities. Integrated care was as effective for insulin dependent as non-insulin dependent patients. Patients in integrated care had more visits and higher frequencies of examination. Costs to patients were lower in integrated care (mean 1.70 pounds) than in conventional care (8 pounds). 88% of patients who experienced integrated care wished to continue with it. CONCLUSIONS-This model of integrated care for diabetes was at least as effective as conventional hospital clinic care.

AB  - Fire-spread was measured on 121 grass fires in a 2500 ha experimental site in the Northern Territory, Australia. Selected plots were harvested to alter the height, load and bulk density of the fuel-bed. Fires were lit from a line and allowed to travel up to 400 m down- wind. Fire-spread was correlated with fuel, weather and fireshape variables using multiple regression techniques. Wind speed had most effect on fire-spread. The influence of the other variables was examined after a model for wind speed and moisture content had been fitted. Fuel load did not influence fire-spread. Fires in natural swards burnt 18% faster than fires in cut grass, but this increase could not be fully explained by changes in the height or bulk density of the fuel bed. Grass type characterised either by species group or by surface-area- to-volume ratio of the fuel particle, did not appear to significantly icfluence fire-spread. Differences in spread rates between the two grasses were attributed to differ- ences in grass curing. The influence of grass curing appeared to be less than indicated by published models. Models of fire-spread in grasslands currently in use need to be revised. Ignition line length was a significant variable influ- encing fire-spread and this must be taken into consid- eration when using experimental fires to validate theo- retical models or develop empirical models from field observations.

AB  - Once rare, wildfires are becoming increasingly common in the Amazon. For the last several decades, Brazil has worked to settle the Amazon. People have cleared many areas and fragmented much of the remaining forest. Most regional land uses are fire- derived, fire-managed, or make the remaining forests more vulnerable to fire. Closed- canopy forests generally remain relatively cool and moist even during the dry season when weeks may pass without rain. However, extreme drought events eventually dry the surface fuels enough to make the forest susceptible to fire. Continual ignition events along forest edges make forest fires inevitable during these periods. Once damaged by either fire or selective logging, the forest canopy becomes fractured, allowing moisture to be rapidly pumped from the forest by small-scale convection cells. These damaged forests dry rapidly and become fire-susceptible nearly every year during the dry season. Poorly adapted to fire, the forests suffer severe damage and high mortality even during low-intensity fires. Each fire results in an increase in fuel loads from dying and decaying trees. Subsequent fires burn more intensely, spread faster, and can kill even the largest, thickest barked trees. Therefore, human land use and the ecological traits of the forest combine to make them susceptible to a positive feedback process whereby fires become more frequent and more severe until the forest collapses and is replaced by grass or scrub vegetation. Ongoing climate change is warming the Amazon and may potentially reduce rainfall or increase drought frequency or intensity. These forests have persisted through many periods of previous climate change. However, the current conditions of ubiquitous ignitions, extensive clearing, fragmentation, and damage to the forests may combine to make large regions vulnerable to fire conversion of these lush biodiverse ecosystems to early successional and impoverished conditions. Without changes in land and fire management, fire will become endemic to many regions, threatening both the native species and the livelihoods of people who live in the Amazon.

AB  - Online (all Chapters) http://www.springerlink.com/content/978-3-540-77380-1 Fire has emerged as a prominent and novel threat to tropical forest biodiversity. This chapter reviews our current knowledge covering nine different themes, examining - faunal mortality and temporal responses to fire, - sub-lethal effects, - the importance of fire severity and the spatial extent of fires, - geographic variation in faunal responses, - the synergistic effects of fires with other disturbance events, - the potential influence of fire on invertebrate communities, - and future research priorities. By necessity, the review is based upon a small number of studies that have a limited geographical focus and a focus on birds, butterflies, and large vertebrates. Although these studies clearly demonstrate the extreme vulnerability of forest species to tropical wildfires, we lack a detailed understanding of how the effects of fire change across different spatial and temporal scales and interact with other ongoing climatic and anthropogenic changes. Developing a better understanding of the consequences of fire for forest fauna is essential for the implementation of effective conservation strategies in fire-prone tropical forests.

AB  - This paper reviews the relationships between land use and climate change. It explores how land use decisions will be affected by future changes in the climate, but also the feedbacks from land use change to the global climate system through greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. Past changes in land use were characterised by decreasing areas of agricultural use and increasing areas of forested and urbanised land. This has led to UK land use being a net sink for GHGs, mostly due to forestation. However, existing forests have on average passed their age for maximum net removals of carbon from the atmosphere. In the next decade at least, net removals from UK forests are likely to decrease significantly. Longer term scenarios of future land use change are consistent in their expectation of further declines in the agricultural area used for food production - offset to some extent by increased bioenergy cropping - along with increases in forested and urban areas. These trends are broadly consistent with the observed past land use change, but are calculated from various assumptions about future changes in drivers rather than by extrapolation from the past. Socio-economic and technological changes are likely to be the most important drivers for land use, with climate change having a smaller influence. The land use changes represented in these scenarios would likely reduce GHG emissions and enhance carbon sinks. These trends would be reinforced by small future changes in the climate, but large climatic changes are likely to cause net GHG fluxes to switch from being a sink to a source. Land use change will also be moderated by potential policy goals that seek to reduce GHG emissions from land and/or increase the size of land-based sinks. This includes strategies to reduce carbon and nitrogen emissions through increased efficiency, afforestation and biofuel production. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore theoretically the qualitative impacts of the planning and development processes on the spatial dynamic interactions between land use and transportation. Specifically, an idealized abstract example of the interactions between two homogeneous regions was studied with respect to various issues related to land use and transportation planning. The study took the form of systems of simple differential equations. Each equation represents the rate of change of either the land use or the transportation condition of a region. Investigation with the two-region model suggested a possibility of spatial and temporal fluctuations under certain planning conditions. By examining the conditions underlying the model equations, planning and developmental practices that may cause system instabilities were identified and discussed.

AB  - The Delphi method is used to predict the impacts of three alternative transportation programs in San Jose, California. Variables projected concern both land use (e. g. , number of single-family housing units) and choice of transit mode. Forecasts are made for 1990 and 2000 for four spatial zones within San Jose. Delphi panelists are individuals familiar with land use and transportation issues in the San Jose area. A preliminary questionnaire survey is used to set general economic conditions and land use policies that serve as a context for specific forecasts of land use-transportation interactions. Strengths and weaknesses of the Delphi method in forecasting land use are assessed.

AB  - Forest fire growth models (FGMs) are widely used in both research and operations. FGMs involve modelling complex physical-chemical dynamic processes over large spatially heterogeneous forest landscapes and long periods under changing weather conditions. Because of their complexity, it is difficult to validate these models. A typical approach is to graphically compare predicted boundaries to the corresponding boundaries of actual fires, which provides is a visual rather than quantitative evaluation of modelling errors of forest fire spread. In this paper, we propose a method to quantify two-dimensional spread process modelling errors, in this case for forest fire spread modelling. We introduce several indices that can be used to quantify spatio-temporal modelling errors of two-dimensional spread processes explicitly and to evaluate overall modelling errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the indices through a case study in which the modelling errors of a forest fire simulated by a FGM are compared with those of a reference fire. The case study illustrates that the spatio-temporally explicit indices do work to quantify modelling errors of forest fire spread compared to a reference model and that this error analysis is not only useful for validating FGMs but also provides a basis for improving them. Because of the similarity of other two-dimensional spread processes to forest fire spread, we suggest potential applications of the method in other spatial spread processes, such as the spread of forest insect and contagious disease. The limitations of the method are presented.

AB  - Metropolitan areas have come under intense pressure to respond to federal mandates to link planning of land use, transportation, and environmental quality; and from citizen concerns about managing the side effects of growth such as sprawl, congestion, housing affordability, and loss of open space. The planning models used by metropolitan planning organizations were generally not designed to address these issues, creating a gap in the ability of planners to systematically assess them. UrbanSim is a new model system that was developed to respond to these emerging requirements and has now been applied in three metropolitan areas. This article describes the model system and its application to Eugene-Springfield, Oregon.

AB  - An international study of fire modelling was conducted prior to the Dalmarnock Fire Test One in order to assess the state-of-the-art of fire simulations using a round-robin approach. This test forms part of the Dalmarnock Fire Tests, a series of experiments conducted in 2006 in a high-rise building. The philosophy behind the tests was to provide measurements in a realistic fire scenario involving multiple fuel packages and non-trivial fire growth, and with an instrumentation density suitable for comparison with computational fluid dynamics models. Each of the seven round-robin teams independently simulated the test scenario a priori using a common detailed description of the compartment geometry, fuel packages, ignition source and ventilation conditions. The aim of the exercise was to forecast the fire development as accurately as possible and compare the results. The aim was not to provide an engineering analysis with conservative assumptions or safety factors. Comparison of the modelling results shows a large scatter and considerable disparity among the predictions, and between predictions and experimental measurements. The scatter of the simulations is much larger than the error and variability expected in the experiments. The study emphasises on the inherent difficulty of modelling fire dynamics in complex fire scenarios like Dalmarnock, and shows that the accuracy to predict fire growth (i.e. evolution of the heat released rate) is, in general, poor. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land system science can contribute to sustainable solutions by an integrated analysis of land availability and the assessment of the tradeoffs associated with agricultural expansion and land use intensification. A land system perspective requires local studies of production systems to be contextualised in a regional and global context, while global assessments should be confronted with local realities. Understanding of land governance structures will help to support the development of land use policies and tenure systems that assist in designing more sustainable ways of intensification. Novel land systems should be designed that are adapted to the local context and framed within the global socio-ecological system. Such land systems should explicitly account for the role of land governance as a primary driver of land system change and food production. ?? 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Long-term studies of land system change can help providing insights into the relative importance of underlying drivers of change. Here, we analyze land system change in Germany for the period 1883–2007 to trace the effect of drastic socio-economic and institutional changes on land system dynamics. Germany is an especially interesting case study due to fundamentally changing economic and institutional conditions: the two World Wars, the separation into East and West Germany, the accession to the European Union, and Germany's reunification. We employed the Human Appropriation of Net Primary Production (HANPP) framework to comprehensively study long-term land system dynamics in the context of these events. HANPP quantifies biomass harvests and land-use-related changes in ecosystem productivity. By comparing these flows to the potential productivity of ecosystems, HANPP allows to consistently assess land cover changes as well as changes in land use intensity. Our results show that biomass harvest steadily increased while productivity losses declined from 1883 to 2007, leading to a decline in HANPP from around 75%–65% of the potential productivity. At the same time, decreasing agricultural areas allowed for forest regrowth. Overall, land system change in Germany was surprisingly gradual, indicating high resilience to the drastic socio-economic and institutional shifts that occurred during the last 125 years. We found strikingly similar land system trajectories in East and West Germany during the time of separation (1945–1989), despite the contrasting institutional settings and economic paradigms. Conversely, the German reunification sparked a fundamental and rapid shift in former East Germany's land system, leading to altered levels of production, land use intensity and land use efficiency. Gradual and continuous land use intensification, a result of industrialization and economic optimization of land use, was the dominant trend throughout the observed period, apparently overruling socio-economic framework conditions and land use policies.

AB  - This guidance has been produced by the Environment Agency for England and Wales in collaboration with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and the Northern Ireland Environment and Heritage Service (EHS). Together these are referred to as “the Regulator” throughout this document. Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) is a regulatory system that employs an integrated approach to control the environmental impacts of certain industrial activities. It involves determining the appropriate controls for industry to protect the environment through a single permitting process. To gain a Permit, Operators will have to show that they have systematically developed proposals to apply the Best Available Techniques (BAT) and meet certain other requirements, taking account of relevant local factors. The Regulators intend to implement IPPC to: • protect the environment as a whole; • promote the use of “clean technology” to minimise waste at source; • encourage innovation, by leaving significant responsibility for developing satisfactory solutions to environmental issues with industrial Operators; • provide a “one-stop shop” for administering Applications for Permits to operate. Once a Permit has been issued, other parts of IPPC come into play. These include compliance monitoring, periodic Permit reviews, variation of Permit conditions and transfers of Permits between Operators. IPPC also provides for the restoration of industrial sites when the permitted activities cease to operate.

ISDN involves the digitization of the telephone network, which permits voice, data, text, graphics, music, video, and other source material to be transmitted over existing telephone wires. The emergence of ISDN represents an effort to standardize subscriber services, user/network interfaces, and network and internetwork capabilities. ISDN applications include high-speed image applications (such as Group IV facsimile), additional telephone lines in homes to serve the telecommuting industry, high-speed file transfer, and videoconferencing. Voice service is also an application for ISDN. This chapter summarizes the underlying technologies and services associated with ISDN.

AB  - Latin America has a long and rich history of land administration projects stretching back to the 1980s and beyond. Unfortunately, this history has not been systematically analyzed nor recorded but is buried in a myriad of reports and other gray literature. Currently, almost every country in the region has a land administration project, incorporating cadastral reform, that is either in preparation or being implemented. It is therefore timely to consider what lessons have been learned from previous experience, in the region and elsewhere, and more specifically how this experience can inform current efforts. This paper starts with a summary of a recent World Bank/USAID initiative to compile lessons learned from land administration projects around the world and follows with the author's view of lessons learned in the context of project design, institutional reform and technical innovation. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Payment schemes for ecosystem services such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) rely on the prediction of ‘business-as-usual’ scenarios to ensure that emission reductions from carbon credits are additional. However, land systems often undergo periods of nonlinear and abrupt change that invalidate predictions calibrated on past trends. Rapid land-system change can occur when critical thresholds in broad-scale underlying drivers such as commodity prices and climate conditions are crossed or when sudden events such as political change or natural disasters punctuate long-term equilibria. As a result, land systems can shift to new regimes with markedly different economic and ecological characteristics. Anticipating the timing and nature of regime shifts of land systems is extremely challenging, as we demonstrate through empirical case studies in four countries in Southeast Asia (China, Laos, Vietnam and Indonesia). The results show how sudden events and gradual changes in underlying drivers caused rapid, surprising and widespread land-system changes, including shifts to different regimes in China, Vietnam and Indonesia, whereas land systems in Laos remained stable in the study period but show recent signs of rapid change. The observed regime shifts were difficult to anticipate, which compromises the validity of predictions of future land-system changes and the assessment of their impact on greenhouse gas emissions, hydrological processes, agriculture, biodiversity and livelihoods. This implies that long-term initiatives such as REDD must account for the substantial uncertainties inherent in future predictions of land-system change. Learning from past regime shifts and identifying early warning signs for future regime shifts are important challenges for land-system science.

For the last several decades, Brazil has worked to settle the Amazon. People have cleared many areas and fragmented much of the remaining forest.  Most regional land uses are fire-derived, fire-managed, or make the remaining forests more vulnerable to fire.   Closed-canopy forests generally remain relatively cool and moist even during the dry season when weeks may pass without rain. However, extreme drought events eventually dry the surface fuels enough to make the forest susceptible to fire. Continual ignition events along forest edges make forest fires inevitable during these periods. Once damaged by either fire or selective logging, the forest canopy becomes fractured, allowing moisture to be rapidly pumped from the forest by small-scale convection cells. These damaged forests dry rapidly and become fire-susceptible nearly every year during the dry season.   Poorly adapted to fire, the forests suffer severe damage and high mortality even during low-intensity fires. Each fire results in an increase in fuel loads from dying and decaying trees. Subsequent fires burn more intensely, spread faster, and can kill even the largest, thickest barked trees.   Therefore, human land use and the ecological traits of the forest combine to make them susceptible to a positive feedback process whereby fires become more frequent and more severe until the forest collapses and is replaced by grass or scrub vegetation.   Ongoing climate change is warming the Amazon and may potentially reduce rainfall or increase drought frequency or intensity. These forests have persisted through many periods of previous climate change.   However, the current conditions of ubiquitous ignitions, extensive clearing, fragmentation, and damage to the forests may combine to make large regions vulnerable to fire conversion of these lush biodiverse ecosystems to early successional and impoverished conditions. Without changes in land and fire management, fire will become endemic to many regions, threatening both the native species and the livelihoods of people who live in the Amazon.

AB  - Food security remains an ongoing global concern: the challenge of ensuring food availability, access, and utility for all, at all times, is yet to be met. The body of literature relating to food security is growing immensely. Land administrators are part of the discourse. Their arguments are spread disparately across academic and professional publications. The distinction between scientific work and political rhetoric is increasingly blurry: the role of land administration needs to be more concisely articulated. This paper provides a new synthesis on the relationships between land administration and food security. It undertakes a review of land administration literature relating to food security. It aims at crystallizing understandings of how land administration supports, or fails to support, food security at a conceptual level, and also the strategic and operational levels of land administration systems. The relationship between land administration and food security appears to be conceptually agreed upon; however, at operational levels the link is less evident. Conceptually, land administration is argued to deliver (and sometimes not deliver) secure land tenure, support for implementation of agricultural policies, access to credit, less litigation, easier land dealings, land taxation, land inventories, and land transaction controls. This enables (or undermines) subsistence farming, development of local agricultural sectors and markets, credit to access to non-local food markets, farm subsidization, more efficient land utilization, fairer international investments, and national food planning strategies. In general, the examined literature tends to focus on problem identification rather than system design. Additionally, the large amount of positive viewpoints need better validation in many cases. Future work needs to concentrate on examining the utility of land information and geospatial tools for food security, extracting lessons from the land administration systems of developed contexts, and improving the links at an operational level.

AB  - Much of the scientific research concerned with land-use and land-cover issues is motivated by questions related to global\n  environmental change. For example, will deforestation continue, and if yes, where, and at what rate? How will demographic\n  changes affect future land use and cover? How will economic growth influence future land use and cover? What will be the magnitude\n  of emissions of greenhouse gases related to land use and cover? A common characteristic of these and other issues related\n  to global environmental change is that they stimulate questions not only about past and present changes in land use and cover\n  but also about their future changes (Brouwer and McCarl 2006). The main objective of this chapter is to summarize the state\n  of understanding about the future of land. What are the range and predominant views of this future? What are the views on\n  the global, continental, regional and local levels? We review what (we think) we know and don’t know about the future of land\n  by reviewing published scenarios from the global to local scale. Our aim is to identify the main messages of these scenarios\n  especially relevant to global change issues, and to recommend how scenarios can be improved to better address the outstanding\n  questions about global change and land use/cover.

AB  - Brownfields are abandoned or under-utilised sites with known or suspected environmental contamination. Public-sector efforts to promote brownfields redevelopment face a dual land-use policy challenge. On the one hand, government agencies must help reduce the barriers to private-sector reuse by addressing the uncertainties created by four major issues: legal liability for contamination; uncertain cleanup standards; availability of funding for redevelopment; and complicated regulatory requirements. On the other hand, brownfields reuse must be connected to wider community efforts to achieve environmental protection, central city revitalisation and reduced suburban sprawl. This involves tackling sustainable development and environmental justice issues: the marketability of brownfields; the social costs and benefits of developing greenfields versus redeveloping brownfields and meaningful community participation. This paper examines the progress by US local, state and federal agencies during the last decade in addressing this dual challenge. It is based on a review of the interdisciplinary brownfields literature, and evidence from Toledo, Ohio, whose experience promoting cleanup and reuse reflects that of many Midwestern and Northeastern cities. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Flexural continuity and axial restraint may have a significant effect on fire resistance. For this reason, the support and restraint conditions are important in fire tests of structural elements. However, to assess the performance of the tested structure, the level of restraint should be monitored, and controlled to reflect the behaviour in real conditions. This has become possible due to the development of new testing facility, “Promethee laboratory”, strongly combined with a numerical modelling approach. A building structure will only be able to provide axial restraint if the part heated by the fire is surrounded by cooler structural members which have sufficient strength and stiffness to restrain the thermal elongation. This stiffness is calculated by the mean of software such as SAFIR (developed at Liege university) or ANSYS and will be implemented as a stiffness matrix. In the fire test, the surrounding structure is represented by 30 hydraulic jacks whose forces will be time dependant and calculated taking into account both the deflected shape and the stiffness matrix of the member. The approach followed to study a floor system is presented. Some results on columns are given. To conclude the full understanding of the phenomena at macro scale level should include the study of what is happening at the intermediate and micro scale levels.

AB  - Arid vegetation is subjected to more or less frequent fire, drought, and sporadic flooding events and grazing. Whilst fire, drought and grazing have been the subject of considerable research, little is known of the impact of flooding in arid environments. In this study we examined opportunistically the effects of a flooding event, and its interaction with fire and grazing on moulding arid vegetation in New South Wales, Australia. We assessed vegetation approximately 2 and 5 years after recession of the water in fenced and unfenced plots subjected to different combinations of flooding and fire. Number of species per area dropped from 11.8 to 5.7 per 625 m2. Vegetation in plots left open to grazing by vertebrates differed from fenced plots, but the amount of variation explained was small compared with flooding and the change over time. The taxa mostly associated with flooding were Eragrostis spp., Pseudognaphalium luteoalbum and the exotic Nicotiana glauca. Major flooding events not only trigger native species' germination and recruitment but may also create an avenue for exotic species to invade. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Patterns of wildfire occurrence at the landscape level were characterised during the period 1990-94 in Portugal. Based on land-cover information within 5591 burned patches (larger than 5 ha) and in the surrounding landscape, selection ratio functions were used to measure fire preference or avoidance for different land-cover types in 12 regions of the country. Shrublands were the most fire-prone land cover, whereas annual crops, permanent crops and agro-forestry systems were the most avoided by fire. In terms of forest types, conifer plantations were more susceptible to fire than eucalyptus, and broadleaved forests were the least fire-prone. There were regional variations in land-cover susceptibility to fire, which may be explained by differences in climate, management, ignition patterns, firefighting strategies, and regional availability. A cluster analysis of regional variations in selection ratios for all land covers allowed the identification of three main geographical areas with similar fire selection patterns. These results can be used for planning landscape-scale fuel management in order to create landscapes with a lower fire hazard.

AB  - This paper examines the potential impact of agricultural and trade policy reform on land-use across the EU focussing particularly on the issue of land abandonment. Using a novel combined application of the well established CAPRI and Dyna-CLUE models it estimates the extent of change across Europe under removal of Pillar 1 support payments and trade liberalisation. Overall, it is estimated that around 8 per cent less land will be farmed under these reforms than under the baseline situation. However, some regions, areas and farm types face more significant reductions. The reforms are particularly felt on livestock grazing farms situated in the more marginal areas of Europe, which also coincide with areas of high nature value. Therefore, farmland biodiversity is likely to be reduced in these areas. However, using a range of environmental indicators, relating to nutrient surpluses, GHG emissions, soil erosion and species abundance, an overall improvement in the environmental footprint of agriculture is likely. In addition, the economic efficiency of the agricultural sector will probably improve. The paper considers several possible options available to deal with any negative aspects of land abandonment. Following the FAO (2006), it is argued that untargeted, rather general agricultural policy measures which maintain land in production are likely to be an ineffective and inefficient way to address the perceived negative consequences of abandonment. A more holistic approach to rural development is required, tailored to the specific context within each area. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

filters out memory crosstalk and provides clean messages patterns. The
integrated structure combines the generalization power of neural
networks with the massive processing capability of associative memories.
Tests have involved image sets which stress the system's discrimination

AB  - Byram's fireline intensity values were calculated in order to estimate the intensities of Japanese forest fires by simulating a test fire using Rothermel's fire spread model, which has been widely employed in analyses of North American forested ecosystems. The sensitivity of the fireline intensity approximation was determined by examining the variation in each of the fuel parameters. The results showed that none of the parameters, with the exception of surface-area-to-volume ratio, had a significant effect on fireline intensity. Therefore, constant values of these parameters could be used in the calculation, regardless of the type of fuel. The estimated fireline intensities were higher for fern grasslands than for forests, and were influenced by both the wind velocity and the slope. The fireline intensity values for most Japanese forests were calculated as below 850 kW m<sup>-1</sup> and were similar to those reported for North American forested ecosystems. However, fireline intensities in Pinus densiflora forests with dense Dicranopteris lincaris undergrowth reached values of more than 20,000 kW m<sup>-1</sup>; similar values have been reported for Mediterranean-type ecosystems, such as fynbos and chaparral, which are widely considered to be adapted to recurrent fires.

AB  - Simulation of moving interfaces such as a fire front usually requires\nresolution of a large-scale and detailed domain. Such computing involves\nthe use of supercomputers to process the large amount of data and\ncalculations. This limitation is mainly due to the fact that a large\nscale of space and time is usually split into nodes, cells, or matrices\nand the solving methods often require small time steps. In this paper\nwe present a novel method that enables the simulation of large-scale/highresolution\nsystems by focusing on the interface and its application to fire-spread\nsimulation. Unlike the conventional explicit and implicit integration\nschemes, it is based on the discrete-event approach, which describes\ntime advance in terms of increments of physical quantities rather\nthan discrete time stepping. In addition, space is not split into\ndiscrete nodes or cells, but we use polygons with real coordinates.\nThe system is described by the behavior of its interface and evolves\nby computing collision events of this interface in the simulation.\nAs this simulation technique is suitable for a class of models that\ncan explicitly provide the rate of spread, we developed a radiation-based\npropagation model of wild land fire. Simulations of a real large-scale\nfire performed by implementation of our method provide very interesting\nresults in less than 30 s with a 3-m resolution with current personal\ncomputers.

AB  - Fire behaviour models are used to assess the potential characteristics of wildland fires such as rates of spread, fireline intensity and flame length. These calculations help support fire management strategies while keeping fireline personnel safe. Live fuel moisture is an important component of fire behaviour models but the sensitivity of existing models to live fuel moisture has not been thoroughly evaluated. The Rothermel surface fire spread model was used to estimate key surface fire behaviour values over a range of live fuel moistures for all 53 standard fuel models. Fire behaviour characteristics are shown to be highly sensitive to live fuel moisture but the response is fuel model dependent. In many cases, small changes in live fuel moisture elicit drastic changes in predicted fire behaviour. These large changes are a result of a combination of the model-calculated live fuel moisture of extinction, the effective wind speed limit and the dynamic load transfer function of some of the fuel models tested. Surface fire spread model sensitivity to live fuel moisture changes is discussed in the context of predicted fire fighter safety zone area because the area of a predicted safety zone may increase by an order of magnitude for a 10% decrease in live fuel moisture depending on the fuel model chosen. © IAWF 2007.

WTP was elicited using a probability model which segments the risk of structure loss into &ldquo;public&rdquo; and &ldquo;private&rdquo; components.</p> <p>Most respondents expressed positive WTP for publicly funded risk reduction activities. These respondents were characterized by tolerance for property taxes, perception of significant risk, high ranking of fire risk relative to other hazards, and high objective estimates of existing risk, and their WTP amounts were positively correlated with income and property value. Given that 97% of the respondents were insured against property loss, the large number of positive WTP responses suggests that substantial non-market and unreimbursed losses are experienced when structures are destroyed by wildfires.</p>

AB  - In previous descriptions of wind-slope interaction and the spread rate of wildland fires it is assumed that the separate effects of wind and slope are independent and additive and that corrections for these effects may be applied to spread rates computed from existing rate of spread models. A different approach is explored in the present paper in which the upslope component of the fire's buoyant velocity is used with the speed and direction of the ambient wind to produce effective values of wind speed and direction that determine the rate of spread vector. Thus the effective wind speed can replace the ambient wind speed in any suitable fire spread model and provide a description of the combined effects on the fire behavior. The difference between current and threshold values of the effective wind speed also can be used to determine whether fire will spread in a given fuel type. The model is tested with data from experiments reported by Weise (1993) in which fire spread was in response to variation in both wind speed and slope angle. The Weise spread rate data were satisfactorily correlated using dimensional methods and the observed spread rate was reasonably well predicted with an existing rate of spread model. Directional aspects of the model were not tested because the Weise (1993) study did not include winds with a cross-slope component.

AB  - In China, rural land is collectively owned at the village level. Village officials usually have the power to reallocate land property across families on an ongoing basis due to demographic changes in the village. Realizing that frequent land reallocation and abusive land requisition will undermine economic productivity as well as social stability, the " Rural Land Contract Law" passed in 2002 explicitly reads that farmland tenure security must be maintained for at least 30 years since the last nationwide reallocation in 1998. The frequency and magnitude of land reallocation in Chinese villages have decreased as a result. However, failure to allocate land to the newly increased population often induced conflicts among village members if the security of land tenure for 30 years was strictly implemented. Administrative land reallocations then still continued in some villages to accommodate demographic changes in these places. Based on an almost nationally representative rural dataset collected in 119 villages of 6 provinces across China in 2008, this paper lays out some stylized facts about the administrative land reallocation after 1998. By analyzing the opinions of over 2200 farmers on the central policy of maintaining farmland tenure security, we are able to rationalize why some farmers support the policy while others oppose it. This analysis helps us to better understand the dilemma between efficiency and equity embedded in the current agricultural land system in China. It is further shown that social conflicts among village members may easily arise either due to administrative land reallocation or due to lack of it. We argue that this dilemma cannot be resolved effectively without coordinated reforms in household registration system which can help hundreds of millions of Chinese rural migrant workers to permanently settle in cities and release their farmland to those who stay in the countryside. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Wildland Fire, 2000, 9(4), 285–292), we proposed a twodimensional fire spread model including slope effects as another step towards our aim to elaborate a fire management tool. In the present study, we improve the model to include both wind conditions and wind combined with slope conditions. For this purpose the effect of wind and slope are considered similar, in the sense that they both force the flames to lean forward. However, this analogy remains acceptable only when flame tilt is below a threshold value. Simulation results are compared to experimental data under wind and no-slope conditions. The proposed model is able to describe the fire behaviour. Predictions of the model for wind and slope conditions are then considered and comparisons with observations are also provided.

However, 11 naturalised Senecio have established and are often widespread in urban and rural habitats. Three endemic Senecio-specialist herbivores - Nyctemera annulata, and Tephritis fascigera - formed novel host associations with naturalised Senecio species and spread into modified landscapes. Host associations for these species were not related to whether Senecio species are naturalised or native, However, the abundances of Patagonoides farnaria and Tephritis fascigera were significantly higher in wildland habitats than rural or urban habitats, and wildland Senecio were on average 1.4 times more likely to experience >5% folivory than urban conspecifics.

AB  - The propagation of grassland fires is simulated using a fully physical based model, partially developed during the FIRESTAR European Union programme. This approach, based on a multiphase formulation, includes the calculation of the degradation of the vegetation (by dehydration and pyrolysis) and the turbulent/reactive flow resulting from the mixing between the ambient gas (wind flow) and the pyrolizate. The solid fuel is simulated as homogeneous distribution of solid particles forming a porous media, interacting with the gas flow using a continuous distribution of drag forces. Other source terms representing the interactions between the vegetation and the gas flow are also taken into account, such as the production of water vapour and gaseous fuel, the radiation of soot particles and ashes, and the convective exchange in the energy balance. The model was validated from preliminary calculations carried out at small scale, for a homogeneous fuel bed (pine needles, excelsior, sticks) and compared with experimental results obtained in a wind tunnel. Calculations are then extended to study the propagation of fires through a flat grassland, for various wind speed conditions. The numerical results are compared to empirical and semi-empirical predictions obtained in similar conditions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The pattern of urban development strongly affects sustainability - energy and water use, food production, waste generation and disposal, biodiversity and equal opportunity. So regional planning must be a tool in achieving sustainability. The traditional urban pattern was a cluster of activities that people do together (city downtowns and neighborhood centers) surrounded by residences in a density gradient. That remains the most sustainable pattern. After World War II, the automobile promoted a pattern of scattered activities and spread out residences. Most other countries resisted the spread and scattered pattern, though without complete success; the US has only begun to recentralize. Three strategies are proposed to recentralize: Pricing goods and services to reflect sustainable needs, improving the magnetism of cities and legislating enforceable regional plans. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines the reform of the land administration system (LAS) in China since 1978, and its benefits, shortcomings and options for further reform. The LAS reform has had significant effects on land use and economic development. It has created a more effective land use system and a market for transfers of land, in particular non-agricultural land. Meanwhile, a basic system of land administration has been realized. Important legislative changes accompanied the LAS reform. Imperfect aspects of the LAS, however, result in some negative effects on land allocation such as the rapid loss of arable land to the non-agricultural sectors, very small land use scale and degrading land quality. A framework of further reform measures dealing with these problems is presented in this paper.

AB  - A meta-analysis of the Land System Science literature identified that small-scale land uses currently receive little attention in studies seeking to understand land use change dynamics. We conceptualised two ways in which small-scale land uses operate to indirectly drive more extensive land use change: (1) through modifying spatial landscape attributes and (2) through altering underlying forces driving the expansion of other land uses. We then propose the concept of ?intensive land uses?, those that occupy a small proportion of the landscape but indirectly drive land use change dynamics through their operation. Our discussion highlights that, with the exception of roads, we currently underestimate the importance of intensive land uses in the literature and we illustrate this with a case study of a commonly disregarded intensive land use: mining. We conclude that the inclusion or exclusion of land uses from analyses should extend beyond quantifying their land use area and instead incorporate an understanding of how land uses operate within their regional context. Finally, we present three future research opportunities to incorporate intensive land uses into analyses and models of land use change dynamics.

AB  - This article investigates land transactions in relation to intended land use change from a micro-scale perspective. A better understanding of land transactions is important for understanding and influencing how land is used. The aim is to explore how the different aspects and their interrelations influence landowner behaviour during land transactions initiated by the government. The study draws on 42 explorative interviews with land purchasers, land policy experts, planning professionals and local farmers. The study shows that uncertainty, and feelings of justice are pivotal aspects during land transactions. Moreover, land transactions are co-evolving with the planning process. Landowners exhibit strategic behaviour based on their personal situation and their expectations on uncertain aspects. The strategies are strongly interrelated with the evolution of land use change. Land use changes are both input on which actors base their strategies, as well as the outcome of those strategies. The aspects found in this study were strongly interrelated and changed over time. Some aspects were context dependent, while others are expected to influence land transactions in general. In this light, the strength of a successful planner is twofold: on the one hand a planner needs to be a good communicator; on the other hand a planner should be able to deal with uncertainty and expectations during plan processes.

AB  - The eng-genes concept involves the use of fundamental known system functions as activation functions in a neural model to create a 'grey-box' neural network. One of the main issues in eng-genes modelling is to produce a parsimonious model given a model construction criterion. The challenges are that (1) the eng-genes model in most cases is a heterogenous network consisting of more than one type of nonlinear basis functions, and each basis function may have different set of parameters to be optimised; (2) the number of hidden nodes has to be chosen based on a model selection criterion. This is a mixed integer hard problem and this paper investigates the use of a forward selection algorithm to optimise both the network structure and the parameters of the system-derived activation functions. Results are included from case studies performed on a simulated continuously stirred tank reactor process, and using actual data from a pH neutralisation plant. The resulting eng-genes networks demonstrate superior simulation performance and transparency over a range of network sizes when compared to conventional neural models. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A software system aimed at the simulation of fire spread over complex topography is presented. The software implements a semi-empirical model for fire rate of spread, which takes as input local terrain slope, parameters describing fuel properties as well as the wind speed and direction. Fire shape is described with recourse to an ellipse-type model. Two different models are implemented for the simulation of the wind field. Both these models predict wind velocity and direction based on local observation taken at meteorological stations. The whole system was developed under a graphical interface, aiming at a better ease of use and output readability so as to facilitate its application under operational conditions. This work describes the mathematical models employed, provides an overview of the graphical interface and presents the results of some simulations tested against experimental data. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Abstract In the era of state socialism under Mao, land in China was treated as a means of production and was allocated administratively by the state free of charge. To accommodate the interests of foreign investors without violating the socialist principle of public ownership, the Chinese state has, since the 1980s, separated land use rights from land ownership and opened up a new market track for the conveyance of land use rights to commercial users. The result has been a distinct dual-track land system in the new political economy, characterized by significant asymmetry for arbitrage. Discrepancy between the state's intention and actual outcome has been a consequence of the internal diversity of power relations concerning land development. Our data analysis reveals that the loss of farmland to nonagricultural developments has slowed down in recent years, that the state's intention to increase land use efficiency has been severely compromised by the socialist legacy, and that illegal activities are perva...

AB  - In recent years, interest in the policy-informing role of research organisations has grown considerably. It has been argued from within the science domain that the management of land, whether at the field, farm or regional scale, can benefit from computer-based systems analysis. This proposition was examined through 26 semi-structured interviews, by conducting a workshop on modelling support in policy decision-making and investigating 11 European-based cases of policy-oriented modelling research. On basis of these materials, we assess approaches towards policy-oriented modelling within the domain of agricultural production and other environmental services of land. First, we define the boundary arrangements for our field of interest, i.e. computer-based systems analysis of agricultural production and ecosystems services. Such ideotypical classification of boundary arrangements makes explicit the institutional space in which system scientists function. This space enables certain activities, and at the same time constrains other initiatives, dependent on who is perceived to initiate and/or control research activities and to formulate objectives, and whether it is considered appropriate to integrate scientific knowledge development with policy work. Five ideotypical boundary arrangements are proposed: 'Civil mandate'; 'Trickle out'; 'Janus face'; 'Critical participant'; and 'Knowledge broker'. In a second step, a number of critical leverage points are identified based on the 11 cases and these are addressed in relation to the five boundary arrangements. The term 'leverage point' covers means, conditions and methods that foster use of modelling work that can be changed, and thus may be part of a strategy to increase the chances that a model is used. The leverage points were: reputation of research institute and/or scientists; raising and balancing expectations; communication about and investment in the scientific basis of the modelling work; participation in model development; heterogeneous and extensive social network in policy domain; institute mandate that secures availability of 'stepping stones'. We conceive of two applications of our research for modellers who are interested in the use of their work in the policy sphere. First, the boundary arrangement classification helps to interpret the experiences of others and to assess the relevance of lessons and suggestions for their own context. Secondly, the combination of the boundary arrangement perspective and critical leverage points presents a basis to design an institutional pathway for enhancing impact of modelling research in the policy sphere. For those researchers functioning in a science-domain-oriented environment, the analysis in this paper suggests that there are more options than the frequently proposed 'more participation' for increasing the likelihood that their policy-oriented work is used. These include establishing contacts with research groups or institutes that are in a position to function as 'stepping stones', or engaging with others to develop a social network in the policy sphere. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic methodology to derive land-use classes from a remotely sensed data derived land cover map at a scale of 1:200,000. The aimof the study is to better understand the land cover/land-use relationship and to enhance the value of a land cover mapping product for the planning and management of natural resources and/or environmental change studies. In the case of the study, the land cover product is generated using the FAO/UNEP ‘‘land cover classification system’’. The methodology is heavily determined by the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery, the classification system used and the expert knowledge of the study area. For any given land cover the associated land-uses are identified as well as the land cover/land-use relationship. It is assumed that these relations can be of four types: one to one, one to many, many to one or a combination of any of the aforementioned possibilities. The land cover/land-use relation need not be consistent across the study area. The parameters used for land-use classification are based on a comprehensive review of the literature, in which land cover and land-use are usually amalgamated. A set of decision rules was established to define land-use classes. These decision rules were tested during the field survey, after which they were applied to the whole study area. The concurrence of land cover and land-use delineations is discussed for the classes identified. The result of the study is a detailed, flexible land-use data set in which the various parameters used for classification can be re-grouped according to user needs.

AB  - Recent changes in land use for tourism and recreation have been driven by socio-demographic shifts, increases in disposable time and incomes, technological changes, transport developments, and emerging systems of policy and governance. Combined with changes in consumption preferences, these have led to general but differentiated increases in tourism and recreation. Outbound tourism has grown more rapidly than inbound, which has led to some displacement of land use demands. In the case of recreation, there are shifts between at home and outdoor recreation, and changes in the content and location of each. The resulting land use trends can be understood in regional, intra-regional (urban versus rural versus coastal) and temporal terms. Future trends are considered in terms of how this broad set of drivers and the relationships between them are being and are likely to be transformed. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - CPU PRIMARY AND SECONDARYSTORAGEThe CPU contains circuits that control and executeinstructions by using some type of MEMORY. Memoryis referred to by size, such as 16K, 32K, 64K, and so on.The "K" represents the value of 1,000. Therefore16,000 is 16K.Semiconductor memory consists of hundreds ofthousands of tiny electronic circuits etched on a siliconchip. Each of these electronic circuits is called a BITCELL and can be in either an OFF or ON state torepresent a 0 or 1 bit. This state depends on whether ornot current is flowing in that cell. Another name usedfor semiconductor memory chips is integrated circuits(ICs). Developments in technology have led tolarge-scale integration (LSI) that allows more and morecircuits to be squeezed onto the same silicon chip.Some of the advantages of semiconductor storageare fast internal processing speeds, high reliability, lowpower consumption, high density (many circuits), andlow cost. However, there is a drawback to this type ofstorage. It may be VOLATILE, which means it requiresa constant power source. When the power for yoursystem fails and you have no backup power supply, allof the stored data is lost.Primary StorageTwo classifications of primary storage with whichyou should become familiar are read-only memory(ROM) and random-access memory (RAM).READ-ONLY MEMORY (ROM).—In computers,it is useful to have instructions that are used often,permanently stored inside the computer. ROM enablesus to do this without loosing the programs and datawhen the computer is powered down. Only thecomputer manufacturer can provide these programs inROM; once done, you cannot change it. Consequently,you cannot put any of your own data or programs inROM. Many complex functions, such as translators forhigh-level languages, and operating systems are placedin ROM memory.Since these instructions are hardwired, they can beperformed quickly and accurately. Another advantageof ROM is that your imaging facility can orderprograms tailored for its specific needs and have theminstalled permanently in ROM. Such programs arecalled microprograms or firmware.RANDOM-ACCESS MEMORY (RAM).—RAMis another type of memory found inside computers. Itmay be compared to a chalkboard on which you canscribble down notes, read them, and erase them whenfinished. In the computer, RAM is the workingmemory. Data can be read (retrieved) or written(stored) in RAM by providing the computer with anaddress location where the data is stored or where youwant it to be stored. When the data is no longerrequited, you may simply write over it. Thus you canuse the storage location again for something else.Secondary StorageSecondary storage, or auxiliary storage, is memoryexternal to the main body of the computer (CPU) whereprograms and data can be stored for future use. Whenthe computer is ready to use these programs, the data isread into primary storage. Secondary storage mediaextends the storage capabilities of the computer system.Secondary storage is required for two reasons. First, theworking memory of the CPU is limited in size andcannot always hold the amount of data required.Second, data and programs in secondary programs donot disappear when the power is turned off. Secondarystorage is nonvolatile memory. This information is lostonly when you erase it. Magnetic disks are the mostcommon type of secondary storage. They may be eitherfloppy disks or hard disks (hard drives)

Predictions are compared to data recorded during laboratory-scale experimental fires conducted across different pine needles bed under wind and slope conditions. Influence of these environmental factors on rate of spread, temperature-time profiles and fire front shapes is then presented. Predictions reveal that effects of flame radiation alone can account for observations up to limit value of slope angle and wind velocity for which convective mechanisms cannot be neglected.

AB  - The conflict between population and land in China results from high population density, declining availability of arable land, decrease in cropland, overgrazing, inability to afford imported grain, and expansion of land use for urbanization.  Unwise decisions have been made.  These decisions have resulted in land degradation, soil erosion, deforestation, degradation of grasslands, waste of land for freight storage or waste disposal due to low grain prices, and nonagricultural constructions on croplands.  Ineffective land management problems are identified as:  1) the lack of an economic means of guiding land use and land is not valued; the lack of any mechanism to ensure economic land use including public lands which are not accounted for with rent; 2) the lack of integration of departments into the decision making structure and too many departments making decisions about the same land; 3) the lack of choice in land use which results in higher government departments being unaware of local conditions, and the lack of appropriate investment which results in short-term exploitation; and 4) surveys are inadequate for decision making.  The strategies suggested for improvement in land use management include low resources expenditure in production and appropriate goods consumption.  The goal is to sustain subsistence with gradual improvement through development.  Land resources must be conserved and the environment protected.  The solutions to depend on food imports or reduce the nutritional level deny the equally plausible solution to generate a higher level of input.  The profit motive and scientific agricultural practices could accomplish this end.  Reclamation for cropland is possible for 8 million hectares of wasteland in wide areas in Sanjiang Plain and 3.4 million hectares in small pockets in Eastern Monsoon China.  Traditional agriculture must be transformed and an optimum scale of land operation established.  Land tenure reform is necessary.  Regional conditions must prevail as the guiding principles.  Several implementation strategies are suggested: controlling population growth and establishing a balance between expenditure and land productivity, expanding and conserving forest areas, increasing agricultural investment, reforming land tenure, adjusting land product prices, strengthening land administration, developing other industries, and reforming economic and political systems.

AB  - Future changes in land use in the coastal zone will be dominated by the effects of climate change. The major effect of climate change on the coastal zone will be due to increasing sea level which, in combination with possible increases in the frequency and intensity of storms, will bring about:•change in patterns of erosion and sedimentation•increased risk of flooding•change in the distribution and types of coastal habitats. The coastline has always been subject to change through erosion and other natural processes. Climate change may speed this change. This will mean profound impacts on low-lying coastal areas over the next 50 years, particularly along the eastern coast of England. These physical changes in the coastal zone will occur alongside, and interact with, a variety of human impacts and drivers of change. Agricultural policy reform, and changes in production in response to this and to climate change, will alter coastal landscapes as well as sediment and nutrient inputs into coastal waters. Demographic change - an increasing UK population, who are on average older and who potentially have more leisure time - will be likely to bring about an increased demand for the recreational opportunities that the coast provides.

AB  - Future changes in land use in the coastal zone will be dominated by the effects of climate change. The major effect of climate change on the coastal zone will be due to increasing sea level which, in combination with possible increases in the frequency and intensity of storms, will bring about:•change in patterns of erosion and sedimentation•increased risk of flooding•change in the distribution and types of coastal habitats. The coastline has always been subject to change through erosion and other natural processes. Climate change may speed this change. This will mean profound impacts on low-lying coastal areas over the next 50 years, particularly along the eastern coast of England. These physical changes in the coastal zone will occur alongside, and interact with, a variety of human impacts and drivers of change. Agricultural policy reform, and changes in production in response to this and to climate change, will alter coastal landscapes as well as sediment and nutrient inputs into coastal waters. Demographic change - an increasing UK population, who are on average older and who potentially have more leisure time - will be likely to bring about an increased demand for the recreational opportunities that the coast provides. This will mean more demand for land for housing and recreational facilities. A continuing trend of rising income levels may also fuel further demand for imported goods and hence the need for further port development, particularly in the south east of England.

AB  - The Amazon is being rapidly transformed by fire. Logging and forest fragmentation sharply elevate fire incidence by increasing forest desiccation and fuel loads, and forests that have experienced a low-intensity surface fire are vulnerable to far more catastrophic fires. Satellites typically detect thermal signatures from 40 000 to 50 000 separate fires in the Amazon each year, and this number could increase as new highways and infrastructure expand across the basin. Many are concerned that large-scale deforestation, by reducing regional evapo-transpiration and creating moisture-trapping smoke plumes, will make the basin increasingly vulnerable to fire. The Amazon may also be affected by future global warming and atmospheric changes, although much remains uncertain. Most models suggest the basin will become warmer throughout this century, although there is no consensus about how precipitation will be affected. The most alarming scenarios project a permanent disruption of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, leading to greatly increased drought or destructive synergisms between regional and global climate change in the Amazon.

AB  - Property ownership rights are well managed and understood in developed countries. They are backed by long-standing theoretical, legal and institutional frameworks. In contrast, many new property interests created by governments in response to concerns for sustainability are often poorly managed and understood. If we are to achieve sustainability objectives, the design and administration of these interests must improve. To do this effectively, a shared understanding of property interests and their role must first be developed. This paper introduces the property object, a tool for describing, comparing and classifying all interests in land and natural resources using five key attributes: the objective, actions regulated, spatial extent, duration and the people impacted. The tool provides a system for structuring and ordering information about land in the virtual environment to better deliver sustainable land management. The concept of the property object was developed by analysing all the legislated land interests within the three levels of government in Australia, but it is universally applicable. It builds on existing theories and approaches to understanding and managing land rights and recognizes the substantial changes in property theory since WWII. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In many fire-prone ecosystems, official fire statistics show that 80 to 95 % of all fires are human-caused. Fire is an old tool to manage the landscape for various human interests. It has also become a danger for vegetation due to negligence-ignited fires. Mechanistic fire models should therefore consider the causes of human-induced fires in order to realistically represent fire-vegetation interactions under changing environmental conditions. The Regional FIRe Model (Reg-FIRM) has been developed as a mechanistic model to simulate fire causes and fire spread explicitly at the regional level. Incorporated into the Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (LPJ-DGVM) it can be used to investigate bi-directional feedbacks between fire and vegetation. Reg-FIRM considers human- and lightning-caused fires and can therefore be applied to human-dominated fire regimes, as they occur in many European forest ecosystems. The focus of this study was to investigate bi-directional feedbacks between fire and vegetation for European forest ecosystems with respect to their sensitivity to changing fire regimes using Reg- FIRM as a simulation tool. The model was applied to peninsular Spain and the temperate forest of Brandenburg, Germany. A sensitivity analysis outlined the role climatic fire danger, human ignition potentials and vegetation composition play for the simulation of annual area burnt at the regional scale. Comparative study of simulated number of fires and area burnt against observations led to improved understanding of the fire regime in both case study regions. Effects of fire suppression on fire regimes in peninsular Spain are hypothesized for historical climate conditions. Vegetation composition influenced fire spread conditions in the temperate forest and had little impact on fire ignition potentials. Under climate change conditions, the number of fires and annual area burnt increase dramatically and are almost double at the end of the simulation period. The objective in this study was to test the flexibility of Reg-FIRM, when applied to other regions, which have different levels of human-dominated fire regimes. The developed simulation tool can be used to assess implications for land management and effects of climate change on vegetation-fire interactions, which opens the tool to a wide range of potential users.

AB  - This study is a contribution to an exercise to construct land use change scenarios for Europe as part of the European Commission funded ATEAM (Advanced Terrestrial Ecosystem Analysis and Modelling) project. The purpose of the study is to examine recent trends in land use change as they relate to forests in the pre-enlargement European Union member countries, Switzerland and Norway, and to construct narratives and preliminary quantitative estimates of future trends in forest land use that are consistent with the four storylines presented by the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). These storylines describe different types of future worlds during the 21st century defined according to societal values (ranging between consumerist/individualist and community-minded values) and according to scales of governance (between globalised and localised). Several quantitative scenarios are associated with each storyline. The analysis indicates a continuous growth of forest area in most parts of Europe in recent years, with an average annual increase of about 0.3 percent. For the future, the study estimates decreasing forest area in the consumer-orientated worlds and slightly accelerated area growth rates in the community-orientated worlds. The scenarios are at a national scale, and could not be used directly as projections on the regular geographical grid employed in ATEAM. Rather, they were intended to serve as reliability or consistency checks for more comprehensive scenarios incorporating urban and agricultural land uses, protected areas and biofuels, constructed within the project. A firm conclusion of the study is that national forest policies currently play a central role in determining future land use in Europe. Future work on scenario development will require a comprehensive framework that integrates policies as key driving forces of land use change.

AB  - Information on fire behaviour in different vegetation types is an essential input in wildland fire management system applications. This paper describes how fire behaviour models derived from experimental burning and wildfire documentation have been used as the basis for developing a number of fire management decision support tools in New Zealand. Three separate spatial applications have been produced for modelling current, historical and forecasted fire dangers using the Fire Weather Index and Fire Behaviour Prediction components of the New Zealand Fire Danger Rating System. Historical peak summer fire climate components were defined for use in the New Zealand Wildfire Threat Analysis model within both the Hazard component (Head Fire Intensity) and the Risk component to model the probability of sustained ignition. This information is useful for long-term strategic fire management planning. Current fire weather, fire behaviour and fire danger are updated daily by the National Rural Fire Authority for dissemination via the Internet to fire authorities and the public. The maps are used for short- to medium-term fire management planning applications. The New Zealand Meteorological Service have incorporated the Fire Weather Index System into their forecasting models to produce hourly forecast maps useful for short- term planning and incident management. This is presented to rural fire authorities through their MetConnect web site. These examples are used here to illustrate the essential links between fundamental research on fire behaviour and development of expedient operational fire management solutions.

AB  - Food security remains an ongoing global concern: the challenge of ensuring food availability, access, and utility for all, at all times, is yet to be met. The body of literature relating to food security is growing immensely. Land administrators are part of the discourse. Their arguments are spread disparately across academic and professional publications. The distinction between scientific work and political rhetoric is increasingly blurry: the role of land administration needs to be more concisely articulated. This paper provides a new synthesis on the relationships between land administration and food security. It undertakes a review of land administration literature relating to food security. It aims at crystallizing understandings of how land administration supports, or fails to support, food security at a conceptual level, and also the strategic and operational levels of land administration systems. The relationship between land administration and food security appears to be conceptually agreed upon; however, at operational levels the link is less evident. Conceptually, land administration is argued to deliver (and sometimes not deliver) secure land tenure, support for implementation of agricultural policies, access to credit, less litigation, easier land dealings, land taxation, land inventories, and land transaction controls. This enables (or undermines) subsistence farming, development of local agricultural sectors and markets, credit to access to non-local food markets, farm subsidization, more efficient land utilization, fairer international investments, and national food planning strategies. In general, the examined literature tends to focus on problem identification rather than system design. Additionally, the large amount of positive viewpoints need better validation in many cases. Future work needs to concentrate on examining the utility of land information and geospatial tools for food security, extracting lessons from the land administration systems of developed contexts, and improving the links at an operational level. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In densely populated regions such as Belgium where land is a scarce resource, nature areas are under increasing pressure of urban and infrastructural development. Decisions regarding land use changes usually do not fully account for the associated environmental impacts and the related social welfare changes. This paper aims to provide a generic monetary value function to assess the public benefits of amenity, recreation and biodiversity values associated with land use changes from agricultural land to different types of nature. This function can be used in cost-benefit analyses to inform decisions on land use changes, including the creation, restoration and compensation of nature areas. The ecosystem services values can be compared to the financial costs of such projects and accounted for in policy-making and planning decisions aimed at maximising social welfare. Important criteria for the development of this value function are that: (1) it should be transferable across sites and able to account for relevant characteristics of both the nature areas and the population of beneficiaries, and (2) it should control for spatial variables, such as size of the area and distance to the respondent's home. The value function of our case study is based on a large scale choice experiment, as part of a survey to capture public preferences, focusing on land use changes among a sample of 3000 households in the Flemish region in Belgium. In the choice experiment, respondents were asked to choose between different hypothetical nature development scenarios, described in terms of their ecological quality (nature type, species richness) and a set of spatial characteristics, including, size, accessibility, adjacent land use and distance to the respondents' residence. The model estimates are used to monetise public preferences for land use changes. The results show that the public attributes significantly different values to the different nature types, with highest values for forests. A distance decay effect was clearly observed, meaning that willingness to pay reduces when nature areas are situated further away from the place of residence. The size of the area was also significant but much less significant than would be expected. The application of the value function is demonstrated in two examples. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper we present a framework for understanding regional land use processes by incorporating the concept of agglomeration economies into agricultural frontier theory. We show that agricultural firms can obtain positive externalities from locating in close proximity to other agricultural firms, leading to agglomeration economies. Agglomeration economies lead to high levels of competition and diversity within a local agricultural supply chain and influence local prices, information flows, and private enforcement of environmental institutions. We use the theory of agglomeration economies to understand the development of soybean production in two counties along the Santarem-Cuiaba (BR-163) highway in the Brazilian Amazon: Santarem, Para and Sorriso, Mato Grosso. We conclude that differences in environmental and land tenure institutions influenced the occurrence of agglomeration economies in these two counties, which in turn affected the total factor productivity of soy in each region. In particular, the supply chain became extremely competitive and diverse in Sorriso where few environmental regulations existed, while environmental restrictions reduced the diversification of the supply chain in Santarem. The presence of a soy agglomeration economy in Sorriso spurred innovation, increased productivity, and led to extremely rapid soy expansion in that county, while the monopolistic supply chain in Santarem reduced producers' access to land and capital and impeded soy expansion.

AB  - The strategy known as wildland fi re use, in which lightning-ignited fi res are allowed to burn, is rapidly gaining momentum in the fire management community. Managers need to know the consequences of an increase in area burned that might result from an increase in wildland fire use. One concern of land managers as they consider implementing wildland fire use is whether they can meet the goals in the land management plan for the desired distribution of forest structural stages across the landscape with further increases in fire. These questions were explored for a 49,532 ha landscape on the Boise National Forest in Idaho that typically experiences mixed-severity and stand-replacing fi res. The landscape simulation model TELSA was used to evaluate how increases in fi re frequency and area burned might affect landscape composition and structure. Information about frequency, annual area burned, and size-class distributions of fi res derived from a fi re atlas for the northern Rocky Mountains were used to defi ne the fi re regime parameters for fi ve different simulation scenarios. Scenarios with higher fi re frequency and area burned resulted in landscapes dominated by earlier successional forest stages and only small patches occupied by large trees. Simulated variability in area occupied by different tree-size classes on this landscape was much greater than the desired ranges defi ned in the land management plan for the forest at large. A measure of dissimilarity (Euclidean Distance) from desired composition was used to evaluate scenarios for their relative ability to achieve long term land management goals. The lowest values of Euclidean Distance were for a scenario that represents a substantial increase in fi re over 20th century fi re regimes. Euclidean Distance increased for scenarios with very high rates of burning, implying an upper limit to the desired amount of fi re for this landscape. These fi ndings could be used to develop guidance for achieving desired conditions with wildland fi re use.

AB  - This review explores the role of land use and land use change as a determinant of the soil's ability to sequester and store carbon in the UK. Over 95 percent of the UK land carbon stock is located in soils which are subjected to a range of land uses and global changes. Land use change can result in rapid soil loss of carbon from peatlands, grasslands, plantation forest and native woodland. Soil carbon accumulates more slowly (decadal) but gains can be made when croplands are converted to grasslands, plantation forest or native woodland. The need for land for food production and renewable forms of energy could have considerable influence on UK soil carbon storage in the future. There is a need to recognise the risk of soil carbon losses occurring when land use change to increase carbon storage is offset by compensatory land use conversions elsewhere that result in net carbon release. The protection of peatland and other organic soil carbon stocks, and the management of cropland, grassland and forest soils to increase carbon sequestration, will be crucial to the maintenance of the UK carbon balance. It will be necessary to develop policy to balance trade-offs between soil carbon gains with other land use priorities. These include the sustainable production of food, bio-energy and fibre crops and livestock, water quality and hydrology, greenhouse gas emission control and waste management, all of which are underpinned by the soil. © 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - A 26-year-old man, practicing for a variety performance as "fire-eater", accidentally inhaled and ingested about 10 ml petroleum. Soon afterwards he developed dyspnoea, an urge to cough, fever up to 39 degrees C and loss of retentiveness. He was treated as an out-patient with doxycycline, 100 mg daily, and aspirin, 500 mg three times daily. While this reduced the dyspnoea, the elevated temperature persisted and he had haemoptysis. Chest x-ray and computed tomography 12 days after the aspiration revealed areas of atelectasis and of liquefaction necroses. Bronchoscopic and cytological examinations showed eosinophilic alveolitis and mucosal necrosis in both main bronchi. The symptoms were improved by two inhalations of beclomethasone four times daily, and systemic treatment with prednisolone, 50 mg daily, together with parenteral antibiotic administration (cefotaxime, 1.0 g twice daily). The focal lung lesions regressed completely within a few weeks. Five months after the aspiration computed tomography merely demonstrated discrete scarring of the previously necrotic lesions. This case illustrates that, even with extensive necrotic lung changes after petroleum aspiration, conservative treatment is justified and likely to be effective.

Traditional design is approaching its physical limitations. The integrated design method is proposed as an preferable technique of the traditional one. In this paper, a general framework of the integrated design method is presented. The dynamic model for multi-link planar manipulators is derived by the finite element method. The PD control strategy is applied in the closed-loop system. The control parameters and structural parameters are optimized simultaneously by solving the integrated design problem. The controlled random search (CRS) technique, which is a simple and flexible global optimization technique, is used to solve the optimal design problem. A simulation shows the integrated design method gives improved system performances.

AB  - The study focuses on investigating models for calculation of risks for fire spread from an industrial building to adjacent buildings. The basic parameters necessary to determine the risk for fire spread are the flame height and the incident heat flux. There is limited information found about flame heights from industrial buildings where the fire breaks through the ceiling. Calculation methods for flame heights and incident heat fluxes are discussed and compared to model scale data and large scale data. A series of model scale tests with flames through openings in a flashed over building are presented and compared to flame height correlations. This paper provides new data and better understanding of necessary input for such calculations. The model scale tests show good correspondence between a simple method to calculate heat flux from a point source and experimental data.

AB  - A pool fire test was conducted in an uninsulated steel container under low ambient temperature condition, at -20{degrees}C. The heat balance of the enclosure fire was analyzed. The size of the container was 12 mx 2.4 m and 2.4 m high, and it was made of 3-mm-thick steel. During the fire test, the fuel mass loss rate was recorded and the temperatures at different positions were measured with high-temperature thermocouples and plate thermometers. The fire scenario was simulated by using fire dynamics simulator software, and the simulated and measured results were compared. The coarse high-temperature thermocouple responded slower, and therefore, temperature measured by the high-temperature thermocouple was corrected to eliminate the effect of the thermal inertia. Furthermore, a simple two-zone model was proposed for estimating gas temperature in the enclosure of the highly conductive steel walls assuming a constant combustion rate. The convective and radiative heat transfer resistances at the inside and outside surfaces of the enclosure were analyzed.

AB  - Amber alleles of the gene tra-3 provide a sensitive assay for amber suppression; without suppression, tra-3 animals are intersexual and sterile above 20 C. Expression of suppressor tRNA either in the mother or zygote results in animals that are phenotypically 'rescued' and hence fertile at 20 C. The initial goal was to assay for transient expression of DNA following microinjection. Kumble, et. al., (Nature 299, 456) had shown that injection of a tRNA fraction from the sup-7 strain into the distal gonad arm of tra-3 animals rescued some of the resulting progeny. I obtained similar results upon injection of the sup-7 gene contained in a supercoiled plasmid. The observed rescue resulted almost entirely from transient expression since none of the rescued progeny expressed sup-7 in their own gonads. In optimizing transient expression, a strong dependence on the site of injection was observed. The most efficient transient expression was obtained following injection near the rapidly dividing nuclei around the distal tip. Some transient expression was also obtained following injection near the bend in the gonad arm and into oocytes. Surprisingly, injection into the center bulge of the distal arm, which until now has been standard for most studies, yielded little or no expression. Transient expression should provide a tool useful in analyzing expression of genes active during oogenesis and early embryogenesis. For most applications, however, one needs transgenic lines expressing a DNA segment of interest. Hence a large number of tra-3 animals were injected with sup-7 containing DNA constructs and transformed progeny selected by continued growth at 20 C. To date, ten independent transgenic lines have been established; each has continued to breed since establishment (ten to forty generations). The nature of injections seem to be critical for stable transformation; the most successful sets of injections have been those in which each worm was injected multiple times (six to ten) aiming for nuclei around the turn in the gonad. Although the first transformants were from injections of sup-7 cloned inside the ends of the transposable element Tc1, it has subsequently proved unnecessary to have any Tc1 sequences in cis or trans. Indeed the highest frequencies so far have been observed after injection of a 4kb sup-7 plasmid with no transposon elements; three transgenic lines were derived from 169 injected parents. At present, doing multiple injections near the gonadal turn, I can inject and recover about 80 animals/day. Including time to follow the injected animals and maintain reagents and stocks, about two and one- half days of full-time work are needed per transformed line. The existing transformants are being characterized both genetically and by Southern blots. Homozygous strains have been derived for five of the ten transformants. In four cases the suppressor locus has been mapped to a chromosome by standard genetics; one suppressor maps on chromosome I, one on chromosome III and two on chromosome II. Of the transformants so far analyzed using Southern blots, each appears to contain several copies of the injected plasmid; these copies appear to have been linearized at different places and joined together. Although some rearrangements are observed, it is encouraging that large (4-7 Kb) fragments from the initial plasmids have apparently been preserved without internal rearrangement. In making some of the transformed strains, the sup-7 containing plasmid had been co-injected with a second, unselected plasmid. In the two such strains so far analyzed, sequences from the second plasmid are also present in the transformed line. This may be useful in co-introducing various genes of interest.

AB  - The paper analyses the period from 1782 to 2006 divided according to the existing political systems in three rural study sites of Slovakia. Two long, monarchy (I.LMP) and revolutionary (II.LRP), and one short new age (III.SNP) periods are compared. The magnitude of land-use and cover changes induced by related driving forces during the different historical periods are also analysed. Three different study sites were selected: cadastre of Král’ov Brod (KB), mountain cadastres: Oˇ cová and Dúbravy (OD), Liptovská Tepliˇ cka (LT). Spatial data derived from historical maps were used in comparison to recent data obtained using Remote Sensing technology. The results showed that the landscape of all three sites has undergone significant changes in land-use and cover during the 224 years. From the long-term point of view there two main trends were observed. The first was significant permanent grassland conversion into arable land at KB where permanent grasslands decreased from 52.7% in 1782 to 0.7% in 2006. Gradual afforestation and permanent grassland conversion to forest land was observed at LT where forest land increased from 67.7% in 1782 to 83.7% in 2006. During the I.LMP period, demographic trends and settlement pattern supported by effective land-use policy were the dominant driving forces. Similarly these driving forces were identified as the most important also for the III.SNP period. But contrary to the I.LMP, driving forces of the III.SNP caused more negative effects (land abandonment) in mountain rural LT region where the current land-use policy seems to be insufficient. Land-use changes during the II.LRP were mostly due to technological development

AB  - Research results indicate that the home and its immediate surroundings within 100-200 feet (30-60 meters) principally determines the home ignition potential during severe wildland-urban fires. Research has also established that fire is an intrinsic ecological process of nearly all North American ecosystems. Together, this understanding forms the basis for a compelling argument for a different approach to addressing the wildland-urban fire problem. It argues for residential compatibility with wildland fire rather than the necessary prevention of fire encroachment on the community.

AB  - Question: Is post-fire, medium-term vegetation dynamics determined by land-use or fire history prior to fire? Location: South-facing slope in the Gallinera valley, Alicante province, eastern Spain. Methods: After mapping the land-use and fire history of the study site using photo-interpretation, we sampled vegetation structure on a set of plots representing the most frequent land-use and fire history combinations on an area burned six years before sampling. We studied the effects of land-use history, comparing the one-fire land-use trajectories. We analysed the effects of fire history; comparing one-and two-fire plots for both previously cropped and uncropped areas. Results: Most variables were not significantly different between the earliest abandoned plots ( abandoned at least 38 years before the fire) and the uncropped plots. On the most recently abandoned plots ( abandoned between one and four years before the fire), the therophyte richness and the ratio of seeder: resprouter richness were significantly greatest. Different fire recurrences did not determine different post-fire vegetation on either the uncropped or the early abandoned plots ( all dominated by fire-recruited seeder shrubs). The most recently abandoned plots had a lower resilience to fire. Conclusions: Land-use history and recent pre-fire land use, in particular, determined the post-fire vegetation in the medium term. The vegetation composition converged during secondary succession among land-use histories. Increasing fire recurrence had a small effect on mature plant communities, due to the combination of life-history traits determining the response to fire of the dominant species.

AB  - Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last two decades Indonesia has experienced immense forest and land fires. Often these fires are associated with extended drought and widespread use of fire to clear previously logged forest and other degraded land in preparation for oil palm, rubber, or pulpwood plantations. There are many reasons for the use of fire in land clearing activities, but probably the most important one is economics. There is still acceptance that fire is the cheapest, fastest, and most effective land clearing method with the added benefit of providing nutrients from ash residues. This paper provides a review of existing information on the financial costs and benefits of using fire for land clearing in agriculture and forestry plantations as compared with zero-burning techniques. The findings indicate that the economic advantage of fire use varies widely and depends on many factors, such as soil fertility, vegetation density, labour cost, equipment and training costs, and the costs of fire management. For large-scale land clearing, the financial analysis of the costs and benefits of fire versus zero-burning shows that when applied to low-volume vegetation, zero-burning methods are not more expensive than burning – and may actually be more cost effective in the long term. This is the case for clearing oil palm or rubber plantations for replanting, low secondary vegetation, and heavily logged-over forest. Under high-volume forest conditions, burning remains less expensive because it is more difficult, time consuming, and costly to dispose of high volumes of piled wood mechanically.

AB  - Stacked dual-polarized antenna element for SAR applications is presented. The antenna element operates in C-band having 8% bandwidth. In order to achieve high isolation between ports generating orthogonal polarization orthogonal placement of two coupling slots has been applied. To provide additional isolation between vertical and horizontal polarizations the feeding lines generating orthogonal polarizations have been placed on different layers of multilayer stripline structure. Contactless hairpin-type band-pass transition between adjacent stripline layers has been designed and applied within the antenna feeding network to eliminate via interconnections and possible excitation of leaky modes. The measured results of the manufactured antenna element are in good agreement with the calculated ones.

AB  - When scientific forest management was introduced in India under British rule in the second half of the 19th century, it provoked great controversy. Intense discussion surrounded the effect fire had on sustainable forestry. Based upon a 2-year empirical survey in the Kadavakurichi Hillock area of the Dindigul District of Tamil Nadu, this paper revisits that earlier debate. The data show that despite shortcomings in tree growth, areas consisting predominantly of forests largely degraded by frequent fire can satisfy the needs of the local population. The various forms of land use practised in these areas are sustainable at low levels, particularly non-timber forest produce management. Statistical analysis and prognosis indicate that local forest use and management through frequent fire should be able to support this region's livelihood under the prevailing poor environmental conditions as well as into the future. The positive aspects of the traditional fire management regime are discussed against the prevailing paradigm of fire prevention. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In a previous study, a two-dimensional non-stationary model of fire\nspread across a fuel bed, which included slope effects, was proposed.\nImprovements of the flame radiant contribution are made in the present\npaper by taking into consideration long-range preheating mechanisms.\nFire front is assumed to be a radiant panel and the amount of energy\nimpinging on the unburned fuel ahead of the fire front is estimated by\nmeans of a view factor. However, computation time of this view factor is\nlengthy and a simplified computation is thus proposed. The predictions\ngenerated by both models are compared to data recorded during\nlaboratory-scale experimental fires conducted across pine needle beds\nfor slopes ranging, from 0 to 30 degrees. First, the slope effects on\npredicted rates of spread, temperature distribution and fire front\nshapes are provided. The influence of fire front width on model\npredictions is also presented. This effect appears to be a significant\nvariable affecting the rate of fire spread and is qualitatively\nrepresented by the model.

Construction of new highways is a key aspect, as they enable a growing flow of people and economic activities, provoking an intensification of the conversion of forests into pasture and agricultural areas. The pavement of road BR-163 accelerates the expansion of the agricultural frontier from the state of Mato Grosso to Pará, inside the Amazon. Today, the Brazilian government applies two main kinds of policies to protect the environment. First by establishing conservation units (CUs) that include an array of reserve types from natural areas to indigenous lands, and second by enforcing the Forest Code (FC), a law that limits the occupation and use of forests. Legal reserve requirements for rural properties are 80% in the Amazon rainforest, 35% in the Cerrado shrublands and 20% in other regions. However, the effectiveness of these policies relies on a fragile institutional capacity, which causes a flawed monitoring, law enforcement and control. To assess the impact of effective conservation policies on land use and deforestation by 2020, we used the LUSMAPA model in combination with two scenarios, one that included different commodity price developments and migration rates and one on the assumption of the institutional strength to uphold the conservation policies. A revision of the FC from an average 80% policy target to 60% effective implementation and disregard borders of CUs by allowing 5% deforestation in CUs, that both corresponds to a 'weak' governmental enforcement, leads to additional deforestation of 41-57%, depending on the commodity price scenario. The results of the simulations are discussed in the light of recent policy changes in Brazil. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - While considerable progress has been made in understanding land use change, land system science continues to face a number of grand challenges. This paper discusses these challenges with a focus on empirical land system studies, land system modelling and the analysis of future visions of land system change. Contemporary landscapes are contingent outcomes of past and present patterns, processes and decisions. Thus, empirical analysis of past and present land-use change has an important role in providing insights into the socio-economic and ecological processes that shape land use transitions. This is especially important with respect to gradual versus rapid land system dynamics and in understanding changes in land use intensity. Combining the strengths of empirical analysis with multi-scale modelling will lead to new insights into the processes driving land system change. New modelling methods that combine complex systems thinking at a local level with macro-level economic analysis of the land system would reconcile the multi-scale dynamics currently encapsulated in bottom-up and top-down modelling approaches. Developments in land use futures analysis could focus on integrating explorative scenarios that reflect possible outcomes with normative visions that identify desired outcomes. Such an approach would benefit from the broad and in-depth involvement of stakeholders in order to link scientific findings to political and societal decision-making culminating in a set of key choices and consequences. Land system models have an important role in supporting future land use policy, but model outputs require scientific interpretation rather than being presented as predictions. The future of land system science is strongly dependent on the research community's capacity to bring together the elements of research discussed in the paper, via empirical data collection and analysis of observed processes, computer simulation across scale levels and futures analysis of alternative, normative visions through stakeholder engagement. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper proposes an improved probabilistic approach using two improved feature representations. These features are color and motion. First, an improved probabilistic model for color-based fire detection is proposed, and candi- date fire regions are generated from this model. Then, an improved motion feature is used for final decision. The performance of the proposed approach showed about 0.2758 accuracy in false positive rate, and 0.2636 accuracy in false negative rate on a benchmark fire video database, which represents a decrease of 46.6% in false positive rate, and a decrease of 52.1% in false negative rate compared to the probabilistic approach.

AB  - Forests and woodland cover roughly one-third of the land surface of the world, and therefore deserve serious consideration in assessments of the socioeconomic impllcatlons of climate change. This article explores expected sensitivities of the world’s managed forests, forest environment and forest sector to future climate change. A varie- ty of studies are summarized. If signifi- cant climate changes occur over the next 50-75 years, forests throughout the world will undergo massive adjust- ments, many of which will in the shorl term be undesirable. Forest manage- ment has high potential for mitigating these effects, but only with support of insightful policy initiatives that take account of potentlal climatic changes.

The framework combines off-the-shelf open source applications, such as Apache, PostgreSQL, MapServer, OpenSSL, and MediaWiki, with proprietary tools such as ArcGIS Server and Flex, using minimal custom code to provide web services for distributed modeling and realistic evolution of data, models, and research. The approach has been developed to assist research collaboration for the Transportation Systems focus areas of the MIT-Portugal program, but it can be appropriate for other collaborative efforts that could benefit from federated systems for LUTE modeling across local and regional agencies and university partners.

AB  - Ii The primary objective of this study is to develop an integrated public transportation planning framework to evaluate and plan Advanced Public Transportation Systems (APTS). With this purpose, a systems approach point of view is adopted to study the influence of new APTS technology in supply and demand transit variables. In this project the Systems Dynamics methodology is adopted to track the dynamic behavior of model variables and feedback loops forming among them. The proposed framework is illustrated in a case study involving automated vehicle location systems (AVL) applied to a small transit community. The proposed approach follows the same steps of the Systems Dynamics method; First, identify some key variables which are not only susceptive to AVL technology but also affect the supplydemand relationship of a bus transit environment. Second, trace and simplify the causal relationships of the variables considering impacts of facility supply changes to passenger demand responses and vice versa. To accomplish this, four detailed sub-models representing parts of the transit system are developed and combined under the Systems Dynamics methodology point of view. Theses Sub-models are: 1) demography, 2) urban transportation planning, 3) bus operations, and 4) evaluation. Finally, to validate the model procedure, the model is applied to a case study. This study attempts to encompass as many as possible factors around a bus transit system environment which can be impacted by new APTS technology to illustrate the use of the proposed framework. Some of these factors include: 1) Demographic characteristics; 2) urban or social activity of the study area and 3) changes to transportation facilities. The case study illustrates how the physical characteristics of the transit systems such as traffic demand, traffic conditions along the transit route, route layout, and bus performance can be affected by the new technology. Since APTS impacts are time dependent a continuous multi-loop simulation technique is adopted to track dynamic changes of all model variables. The analysis of the transit system is carried over a 20-year life cycle to illustrate the long term dynamics of the feedback structures inherent in the model.

AB  - Canyons or ridges are associated with a large number of fatal accidents produced during forest fires all over the world. A contribution to the understanding of fire behaviour in these terrain conditions is given in this paper. The basic geometrical parameters of the canyon configuration are described. An analytical model assuming elliptical growth of point ignition fires and constant values of rate of spread is proposed. A non-dimensional formulation to transfer results from analytical, numerical, laboratory or field simulations to other situations is proposed. An experimental study at laboratory scale on a special test rig is described. A wide set of canyon configurations were covered in the experimental program. In spite of the relatively small scale of the experiments they were able to put in evidence some of the main features found in fires spreading in this type of terrain. They show that in practically all cases the rate of spread of the fire front is non-constant. On the contrary, the fire has a dynamic behaviour and its properties depend not only on the canyon geometry but on the history of fire development as well. The convection induced by the fire is enhanced by terrain curvature and the fire accelerates causing the well-known blow-up that is associated with canyon fires. The rate of spread of the head fire increases continuously even in the absence of wind or any other special feature or change of boundary conditions that are sometimes invoked to justify such fire behaviour. The results of the present study confirm the predictions of a previous numerical study of the flow and fire spread in canyons that showed the important feedback effect of the fire on the atmospheric flow and how this affects fire behaviour in canyons. Results from a field experiment carried out in a canyon-shaped plot covered by tall shrubs were used to validate the laboratory scale experiments. Case studies related to fatal accidents that occurred in canyon-shaped configurations are analysed and recommendations to deal with this problem are made. It is shown that these accidents may occur even in the absence of special fuel or atmospheric conditions as they are intrinsically related to terrain configuration.

AB  - Sarawak Land and Survey Department is a multi-functional organization under the State Ministry of Planning and Resource Management. The core businesses of the Department are survey, land administration, planning and valuation. Under the Federal Constitution, land is a state matter. We have a well established and unified land cadastre and registration system based on the Torrens principle. The basic features of land parcels and their boundaries are recorded in the cadastre to provide a legal definition of a land parcel. The cadastral information which formed the core data for land management and land administration has been converted to create a geospatial enterprise database. Taking advantage of the organizational structure as a land professional agency involving in land, survey, planning and valuation services, the Department developed GIS applications and solutions as part of the integrated land information system to record land ownership, land values, land use and other land-related data. Enterprise land information for a multi-functional organization like us is vital and essential for managing information on current land use, monitoring changes in land use, for a market economy to function efficiently, to benefit tenure security, to support land use planning and valuation, and to achieve sustainable management of land resources. Land management is the challenge of allocating land resources into efficient use to the best advantage of the State and the people. Land administration is the process whereby land and information about land can be effectively managed, supported by a strong legal framework and good governance.

AB  - The land administration system in the Philippines, as in other developing countries, serves as an important asset and a catalyst for the country’s poverty reduction and economic development agenda. However, weak governance, including the lack of serious efforts for instituting reform in the sector, not only undermines its huge potential but threatens the country’s global competitiveness. This article untangles the complexity of the system; provides a closer look at the laws, institutions and processes as they affect all people, especially the poor; and suggests good governance principles as the way forward. Instituting good governance in land administration within a country with a highly complicated legal and political environment comes with enormous challenges, but is not without hope.

AB  - In forestry Northern Ireland is one of the most impoverished parts of the European Union as well as the United Kingdom. During the last 10-15 years as afforestation projects gathered speed in many parts of the British Isles there has been no notable change in Ulster. One main contributor to this problem was the political uncertainty and violence which has now largely been remedied since the establishment of the devolved government in 2007. In addition to the recently established political stability there is an equally welcoming factor which is likely to impact positively upon the fortune of forestry sector in the province; that is carbon trading rights under the Kyoto Protocol. The use of new forests as credit towards reducing carbon dioxide emission is an important part of the Kyoto deal and quantities of sequestrated carbon can now be used to offset against emissions elsewhere and in this way they become real benefits like timber values. Therefore, the amount of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere by way of afforestation projects should be assessed in economic evaluation of forestry investment proposals. The main purpose of this paper is to carry out a cost-benefit analysis for an afforestation project in Northern Ireland with a view to finding out what difference carbon sequestration will make to the economic rate of return. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - During the last decades Mediterranean systems are being affected by important land use changes which are transforming the entire landscape. Traditional irrigated lands have constituted one of the most characteristic agro-landscapes in the Mediterranean and have played a relevant socio-economic, ecological and environmental role. However, these valuable agro-landscapes are progressively decaying due to recent socio-economic changes which, at the same time, are promoting new irrigated lands outside the river valleys. These new irrigated lands have a major effect on land, water resources, landscape and the biodiversity value of extensive tracts of the Mediterranean area. At the same time, Mediterranean drylands are quickly disappearing due to land abandonment. In addition, Mediterranean areas are suffering a quick urbanisation process affecting both natural and agricultural areas. These trends may be considered as a reduction of the most characteristically rural Mediterranean landscape to favour ecologically extreme landscapes: on one side the natural areas and on the other side the new irrigated lands and urban areas. It is necessary, therefore, to understand the factors driving the land use changes in the Mediterranean, to analyse their ecological effects and to explore the potential implications of several policies regarding land use and natural resources. To this aim, we have analysed the land use changes and their socio-economic and environmental context in three study cases in Southeastern Spain, an arid Mediterranean area where the four above-mentioned land use changes are taking place. These study cases are the traditional irrigated land of Murcia, the agricultural system of Mazarron-Aguilas and the land use changes in the Mar Menor watershed. The ancient Murcia irrigated lands constitutes a paradigmatic example of the loss of this valuable agro-landscape and its highly fertile soils due to the urbanisation process and spread of infrastructures. The Mazarron-Aguilas new irrigated lands may be considered as representative of the most intensive agricultural systems in the Mediterranean area, which are quickly spreading at the expense of drylands and natural areas. The Mar Menor watershed have suffered important agricultural and urban-tourist land use changes affecting the hydrological and nutrient dynamics and the biological communities of the coastal lagoon and associated wetlands. An integrated approach has been applied combining GIS, Remote Sensing, spatial and environmental modelling and dynamic system models to analyse the sustainability of these three case studies, the spatial and temporal patterns of land use, the main socio-economic and environmental driving factors and their ecological implications.

The design of the structure was performed using computational fluid dynamics, heat transmission, and electrophoresis simulation. To improve DNA separation resolution, microchannel with narrow width at the corner was adapted. The deep X-ray lithography process using synchrotron radiation ‘‘New SUBARU’’, nano-imprint, and fusion bonding without bonding adhesive was applied for the fabrication of the integrated structure of microchannels. It was demonstrated that the proposed integrated structure of microchannels results in a good performance of the on- chip DNA amplification and separation in a small MCE unit area of 9 mm 9 9 mm.

AB  -  In this paper, we introduce a three dimensional topology and present its RF characteristics. This topology consists of a MOSFET transistor positioned underneath an integrated inductor with both elements placed on the same silicon die so as to form a three-dimensional integrated structure. The advantage of this structure is that it uses the vacant area underneath the inductor so as to minimize the actual surface it occupies and make its usage more economic and area efficient for analog integrated circuit design.

AB  - A fire spread experiment was conducted in the field under wind-blown conditions. The fuel consists of tall and dense Mediterranean shrub vegetation. The plot area was about 30 m wide and 80 m long. This experiment was conducted not only in order to increase the knowledge and understanding of the fire behaviour in the field but to provide data for the validation of physics based models of fire spread. In particular, the effects of wind on the geometric and thermal properties of the flame front in the field were investigated. The flame temperature along the vertical direction and the radiation emitted ahead of the flame front, were measured. The methodology employed in this experiment and some quantitative measurements of wind velocity and direction, flame geometric properties, are also presented and discussed. The measurements and observations exhibit that the behaviour of the fire and the flame structure character are very different from the one encountered at laboratory scale. These preliminary results show that large scale turbulence influence fire spread and affects the flame shape, temperature and radiation emission. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The 1990s saw two different and even contradictory trends in Israel. On the one hand, there was a substantial increase in environmental awareness, on the part of both the general public and decision-makers, that led to a change in the land use planning policy at the national level. On the other hand, the Israel Lands Council (ILC), the body empowered by law to shape the national land policy, made a series of decisions that severely violated the principle of preserving agricultural land and led to massive conversion of agricultural land and open space for commercial, industrial, and residential development. Thus the national land policy became incompatible with the land use planning policy and the rise in environmental awareness it reflected.The purpose of this paper is to examine the changes in the ILC members' attitudes toward the principle of preserving agricultural land. The findings point to a complex and ambivalent relationship, in Israel's national land policy, between Zionist-nationalist considerations and the principle of preserving agricultural land. They also point to fundamental changes in this relationship over time.

AB  - Transportation and land use interact with each other in a mutual and dynamic manner. Changes in transportation systems create new accessibility levels that influence land-use patterns. Land-use changes in turn modify activity and travel patterns, which induce further changes in transportation systems. In addition, transportation and land-use interaction is influenced by other ongoing dynamic processes in an urban system. Many theories and models have been developed to improve our understanding of the mutual effects between transportation and land use. However, it remains a challenge to identify and forecast transportation and land-use interaction in contemporary urban areas since the interplays between different processes occur at various spatial and temporal scales and it is difficult to isolate the effect of one process from the others. Due to the desire of implementing innovative transportation and/or land-use policies to help achieve sustainable development, transportation and land-use interaction are likely to continue receiving attention from policymakers. Although we may not be able to answer all of the questions related to transportation and land-use interaction in the near future, recent progress in related theoretical work, methodological improvements, and technological advancements have shown promising potential of gaining further understanding of this subject.

AB  - Cassava is a major smallholder crop in much of Africa where it is attacked by 2 main virus diseases. African cassava mosaic disease (ACMD) cassava African mosaic bigeminivirus (CAMV) occurs almost everywhere that the crop is grown causing severe losses in some countries. Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) cassava brown streak potyvirus is of more restricted distribution being prevalent mainly on the east African coast and shores of Lake Malawi. Although both diseases have been known for many decades and much is known about ACMD, the aetiology and epidemiology of CBSD remain poorly understood. Control measures for CAMV have been recommended and in some cases implemented in a number of countries. Resistant varieties have been developed and national research programmes and international agencies are supporting phytosanitation programmes, based mainly on the distribution of CAMV-free planting material. It is suggested that it may be possible to use the same control measures against CBSD but the lack of basic information on the disease and difficulties of disease diagnosis are obstacles to the design of control strategies. ACMD is found in most areas where CBSD occurs and control measures must consider the disease complex. The current knowledge about the 2 diseases is reviewed in the context of possible integrated control.

AB  - The relationships between land use and biodiversity are fundamental to understanding the links between people and their environment. Biodiversity can be measured in many ways. The concept covers not only the overall richness of species present in a particular area but also the diversity of genotypes, functional groups, communities, habitats and ecosystems there. As a result, the relationships between biodiversity in its broadest sense and land use can be complex and highly context dependent. Moreover, the relationships between them are often two-way, so that simple relationships between cause and effect can be difficult to identify. In some places, specific land uses or land management practices may be important in sustaining particular patterns of biodiversity. Elsewhere, the uses to which land can be put are highly dependent on the biodiversity resources present. The review will consider how changes in the quantity, quality and spatial configuration of different aspects of land use can impact on different components of biodiversity, and what direct and indirect factors might drive these changes. The need to distinguish between land cover and land use will be discussed in relation to the economic and social drivers of land use change. The review will also consider whether framing biodiversity objectives involves society in placing constraints upon the types of land use and management practice that are possible, and will consider such arguments in relation to assessments of the costs of biodiversity loss. It would seem that while considerable progress has been made in mapping out plausible futures for land use and biodiversity at global and regional scales, closer integration of modelling, scenario and field-based monitoring is needed to strengthen the evidence base available to decision makers. Challenges that face us include how we take account of the qualitative changes in land cover, and the impacts of such modifications on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Broader perspectives on the value of biodiversity and ecosystem services are also needed as the basis for developing adaptive and flexible approaches to policy and management.

AB  - This paper presents a comparison of two parametric fire modelling techniques (Eurocode 1, and the BFD curve method) and one field model (fire dynamics simulator) against large-scale post-flashover test data. Using a method of the product moment correlation coefficient, it is shown that the BFD curve predictions are most closely representative of reality. For the computational test data, two grid resolutions are adopted in the FDS field model, the finer of which having comparable results in terms of regression analysis to the BFD method. Both the field model and the BFD curve method were found to give better predictions compared to the Eurocode method over the duration of the test. However, a direct comparison of the maximum gas temperatures shows the field model to be poorer in its predictive capability than the parametric methods, under-predicting the maximum gas temperatures. In addition, a more in-depth analysis of the FDS predictions indicates that by considering simply average compartment temperatures the more inaccurate spatially specific temperature predictions were disguised. This study provides useful quantitative data on the three techniques presented and discusses more general issues concerning fire modelling. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In 1997 the entire Indonesian archipelago suffered from serious droughts associated with the climatological phenomenon known as El Nino Southern Oscillation. This resulted in an unprecedented fire episode where more than 9 million hectares of land were burnt in Indonesia. Smoke from the fires hung as a huge blanket over Southeast Asia, covering large cities such as Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, restricting traffic (air, sea and land) and causing a severe health hazard. The smoke originated mainly from fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan. Analysis of the number and distribution of fires (detected as 'hot spots' by NOAA satellite imagery) indicates that the distribution of fires in time in Sumatra was very narrow. Of the 31,500 'hot spots' recorded over a twelvemonth period starting September 1997, one-third were recorded during a single week (12-18 October 1997). The spatial distribution also showed a narrow spread. Almost a quarter of all fires recorded from September 1997 until July 1998 were in the lowlands of the province of Sumatra Selatan. Although the term 'forest fire' was frequently used, there is no evidence that primary lowland or mountain forest suffered much from burning. What did burn however was swamp forest vegetation and secondary vegetation regrown after logging. The causes of these fires were multiple and different from one province to another. One of the main causes though was land clearing for new plantations.

AB  - A new methodology for the integrated structure and control design is developed and applied to flexible robot arms. To maximise performance from an electromechanical system, the structure design and controller design should be performed concurrently. The final design of structure is thus better suited for control. The finite element method is used to model the system for dynamic analysis. Various system characteristics including poles and seros are described as functions of design variables, which are geometric parameters describing the finite element model of the structure. The relationship between the design variables and the system characteristics are linearised by using the generalized jacobian. The inverse problem, that is to find design variables that provide specified system characteristics, is then solved by using the pseudo-inverse of the jacobian. The example of a single link flexible structure is considered and the structure is optimised with respect to the first natural frequency. The moment of inertia about the actuator axis is reduced and the end-point deflection is kept within a given bound. Some of the critical issues of the design process are highlighted.

AB  - From the beginning of fire research efforts in Canada, forest fire behavior research has been empirical in nature, producing fire behavior predictions based on models derived from field experiments. The models relate fire behavior to weather based fuel moisture codes and relative fire behavior indexes. Experimental fire sizes attempt to reflect equilibrium fire behavior conditions for the chosen fuel/weather conditions. Laboratory-based research in moisture physics and heat transfer theory provide the framework by which the field data are analyzed. The Canadian Forest Fire Behavior Prediction System is the culmination of this research on quantitative fire behavior. The ongoing goal is the production of a universal fire behavior model combining field experimental evidence with physically-based models.

AB  - This paper is devoted to the study of the advection effect on the fire spread across a fuel bed by means of a semi-physical model. This work is a step forward in our general process which consists in elaborating a simple model of fire spread to be used in a simulator. To this end, a thermal balance including an advective term coupled with a wind velocity profile in the burning zone is presented. Following our general procedure that consists in using the multiphase approach to elaborate our semi-physical model, we used the momentum equation of the multiphase model to set this wind profile. The predictions of the model were then compared to experimental data obtained for fire spread conducted across pine needle litters. Different slope values and varying wind velocities were considered. The experimental tendency for the variation of the rate of spread was predicted, especially for the higher values of wind. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The research is of particular relevance since it develops a management model which links the operational aspects of land administration with land policy.

AB  - We studied the long-term elects of an intensified fire regime following logging and altered land use practices on the biodiversity and successional dynamics of forests on three sites (Sugihan, Mesuji, and Pampangan) of roughly 300 km(2) each, distributed across the continuous wetland ecosystem of southern Sumatra. Satellite image analysis and ecological and socio-economic surveys were combined to reveal the vegetation characteristics, and links to fire, land use history, and site conditions.Since the 1970s-1980s, this ecosystem has been subject to widespread repeated fires associated with or following intensive logging, transmigration, and plantation development, sonor or swamp rice cultivation, and other local resource use. Burn traces in the soil profile suggest that earlier fire episodes were far more limited in their coverage than the severe and frequent burning of the recent past. The result has been a rapid transformation from mature, high mixed species forests to sedge grasslands, savannas, and open to dense mono-specific stands of fast-growing fire-adapted species. Current vegetation types are largely differentiated by structural rather than compositional differences, which are significantly linked to fire frequency or time since last fire. The more frequent and recent the fires, the more open the landscape, with reduced density and basal area of trees.At present, the area is very species-poor. Most patches in Sugihan and Mesuji are dominated by a single species-Melaleuca cajuputi-in the tree, sapling, and seedling layers except for degraded mixed forests which have a mix of species in all layers. Degraded mixed forests were more recently logged and burnt just once in 1991. Pampangan has a different species composition with all patches dominated by Combretocarpus rotundatus in the tree layer, which is linked to greater organic matter depth. However, in the deep peats of Pampangan the sapling and seedling layers are also dominated by Melaleuca cajuputi in most patches suggesting a future shift in overstory composition to this more freshwater wetland-adapted species. This compositional shift is likely due to peat subsidence and increased likelihood of flooding following repeated burning.The live fuel structure with tall, dense lower strata to mid-strata of flammable herbaceous and woody species and scattered to dense tree cover renders all the vegetation types extremely fire-prone in dry years. The flammable vegetation combined with increased development and population pressures on these last frontiers makes continued widespread fires highly likely. This will lead to further simplification of species composition and structure, and degradation of the landscape into treeless plains.Resource depletion has led to falling incomes and fewer livelihood options in southern Sumatra. Fires and their negative impacts have expanded into the northern provinces of Sumatra as well with timber and oil palm plantation development and/or migrating populations in search of livelihood options. Given the large contribution of peatland fires to trans-boundary haze, carbon emissions, and global warming, reducing and controlling fires in the wetlands of Sumatra is of high priority. Fire management issues and options for the wetlands of southern Sumatra are discussed.

AB  - Fire frequency, area burned, and fire severity are important attributes of a fire regime, but few studies have quantified the interrelationships among them in evaluating a fire year. Although area burned is often used to summarize a fire season, burned area may not be well correlated with either the number or ecological effect of fires. Using the Landsat data archive, we examined all 148 wildland fires (prescribed fires and wildfires) >40 ha from 1984 through 2009 for the portion of the Sierra Nevada centered on Yosemite National Park, California, USA. We calculated mean fire frequency and mean annual area burned from a combination of field- and satellite-derived data. We used the continuous probability distribution of the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) values to describe fire severity. For fires >40 ha, fire frequency, annual area burned, and cumulative severity were consistent in only 13 of 26 years (50 %), but all pair-wise comparisons among these fire regime attributes were significant. Borrowing from long-established practice in climate science, we defined "fire normals" to be the 26 year means of fire frequency, annual area burned, and the area under the cumulative probability distribution of dNBR. Fire severity normals were significantly lower when they were aggregated by year compared to aggregation by area. Cumulative severity distributions for each year were best modeled with Weibull functions (all 26 years, r2 ≥ 0.99; P < 0.001). Explicit modeling of the cumulative severity distributions may allow more comprehensive modeling of climate-severity and area-severity relationships. Together, the three metrics of number of fires, size of fires, and severity of fires provide land managers with a more comprehensive summary of a given fire year than any single metric.

This shared mental model provides a frame of reference for the actions of political players such as politicians, special interest groups as well as the Supreme Court in shaping the design and implementation of Israel' land policy. However regarding the Israeli land decision the ability of the Supreme Court to determine policy is limited on the implementation level. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The United States alone spends about $700 billion a year on new and renovated construction. About 20% of this money assures safety from unwanted fires, and this portion includes the cost of insurance to families and businesses. This enormous cost could be reduced by introducing fire safe products to the building and transportation industries, both in the United States and abroad, and by introducing advanced detectors, suppression systems, and firefighting equipment to the fire protection industry. In order to show that these products and mechanisms are safe to use, industries need performance measures. Performance-based fire standards are currently being developed to augment prescriptive standards around the world. Performance-based standards are intended to provide flexibility in maintaining accept; ed fire safety levels among competitive products, while ensuring life safety and reducing property loss. At the same time, performance-based requirements should reduce design and construction costs, as well as the cost of maintenance and liability coverage. In order to derive these benefits, evaluation tools are needed. One such tool, HAZARD I, helps users understand the consequences of unwanted fires by making the results of recent fire research available to them. Improvements to the program will include increased applicability, improved usability, the ability to address additional building features, and more accurate treatment of fire behavior and its effects on people and their actions. Many of the improvements made already in the software documentation ate based on the experience of fire protection engineers and others who have used the program. User input, combined with other planned program improvements, constitute the first step in the overall goal of a complete Fire Hazard assessment methodology.

AB  - The models to prevent accidents from occurring in process industry, or to min- imize the harm if an accident does take place, always revolve around forecasting the likely accidents and their impacts. Based on the several effects of an acci- dent on the environment, the approach used in this study involves a qualitative analysis by the Environmental Effects Analysis (EEA) combined to Quantitative Risk Assessment approach (QRA). In fact, the EEA, under its current formalism, emphasizes environmental effects in normal operations solely. It does not con- sider abnormal situations (accidental aspects). In order to overcome this lack, the authors propose an extension of the current formalism of the EEA through the inclusion of accidental events that may occur in each phase of the product’s life cycle, where from the EEA – Accidental Aspect method. Impacts associated with abnormal situations are identified and assessed in accordance with risk assessment practices. Risk assessment can be both qualitative and quantitative. Nevertheless, whenever possible, we adopt a Quantitative Risk Assessment approach (QRA). The evaluation criteria used in the classical EEA, i.e. Environmental Priority Number (EPN), is redefined to take into account the impacts due to accidental aspects. By doing so, we establish an effective link between methods for assess- ing environmental impacts and approaches to risk management. The validation of the proposed methodology is made on a storage system with a high potential of fire risk.

The integrated structure/control objectives consist of natural frequencies and an optimal control performance index with weighted system state regulation errors and control efforts, subject to some side constraints on design variables that describe the geometry of the suspension. Two multiobjective optimization techniques, goal programming and compromise programming, are implemented through an interface program communicating with an advanced finite element analysis program. The feasibility of the optimal design is demonstrated and the final decision making is also discussed.

AB  - We investigated the effect of fuel age on the truncation of spread of unplanned fires using a set of 1473 patches in the Sydney region of Australia. Twenty-two percent of patches derived from prescribed fire experienced a subsequent unplanned fire within 5 years, compared with 42% of patches derived from unplanned fires. Among those encounters, the subsequent unplanned fire stopped at the leading edge of 18% of prescribed patches and 11% of unplanned patches. In comparison, the subsequent fire stopped somewhere in the patch for 44% of both prescribed and unplanned fires. Overall, there was a 10% chance that a prescribed burn patch would experience an unplanned fire that stops within the patch. Statistical modelling revealed that the presence of a road barrier was the best predictor of the likelihood of stopping on the leading edge, but fuel age and weather also had an influence. Stopping on the trailing edge was less influenced by the variables analysed. In extreme weather, even 1-year-old patches have a low likelihood of stopping unplanned fires. Fuel age had little influence on the spread of unplanned fires. Consequently, prescribed fires will be most effective when sited at the urban interface where resultant reduced unplanned fire intensity will be a benefit.

AB  - Groundwater has three major roles in our environment: providing the baseflow that keeps most rivers flowing all year long, maintaining good river water quality by diluting sewage and other effluents, and as an excellent source of water supply, providing over 75 per cent of the potable supply in some regions. Groundwater is intimately connected with the landscape and land use that it underlies, and most of the landscape and is vulnerable to the anthropogenic activities on the land surface above. Land use affects groundwater resources through changes in recharge and by changing demands for water. Inappropriate land use, particularly poor land management, causes chronic groundwater quality problems. Acute groundwater quality problems are common and arise from unsuitable land use and control, notably through point sources of hazardous chemicals. Current land use instruments have only been designed to address quality issues in groundwater and do not consider recharge. These instruments have been largely ineffective in protecting groundwater from diffuse pollution for several reasons including fragmentation, their general absence of teeth, and their lack of integration into the land use planning system. This paper argues for a more radical approach which would zone land according to its overall vulnerability and resilience to anthropogenic and climatic influence in order to sustainably support the ecosystem services it can deliver. Land use would be matched with the vulnerability of the soil, with geology and water, and with the whole ecosystem. The Water Framework Directive offers a mechanism to do this, but there is no evidence of enough political will to tackle the long-term conflicts between land use and groundwater. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - Severe bushfires in Australia are responsible for substantial property damage and loss of life particularly at the urban/rural interface of larger cities. The awareness of the bushfire risk by residents living at the urban/rural interface is a mitigating factor in determining the likelihood of residents undertaking fire prevention activities and the actions they may take in the event of a major bushfire. A survey of residents in the urban/rural interface was undertaken to examine issues of fire safety including bushfire risk, bushfire knowledge, fire prevention, communication and education. A significant proportion (p < 0.05) of surveyed residents (52%) living in the urban/rural interface acknowledge that they live in a very high fire risk area. Surveyed residents that were new to the area or had a lower fire-related knowledge perceived bushfires to be a lower threat. Fire prevention by residents was significantly lower (p < 0.05) for non-property owners than property owners. There was also a perception by more than half of the respondents that fire authorities would protect individual homes during a bushfire. This study suggests there is a need to develop further community education and self-reliance amongst residents in the urban/rural interface. Education and self-reliance are critical to ensure self-protection of residents during bushfires and enhance complementary action provided by local fire authorities.

AB  - The present study concerns a hazardous event which occurred in an industrial storage tank of a ground insecticide. A preliminary post-accident approach of the hazard evaluation is performed. The rapid report of the presence of an unstable functional group in the active product and of its potential thermal instability (CHETAH indices) has led to complete this examination by an experimental study of thermal analysis using isotherm exposition measurement (DTA) or with temperature programming by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and oxidability tests (BAM). The apparent kinetics of decomposition of the active matter of the ground insecticide has been represented by a global Arrhenius law. A model designed for the simulation of heterogeneous thermal runaways based on the numerical solution of the transient mass and energy balances has been further applied to define the critical conditions of the storage and simulate its behavior. The results obtained during this analysis with the experienced feedback allowed us on one side to explain the hazardous event and especially on the other side to modify the operating protocol of the conditions of formulation of the active matter on the inert mineral support. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land consumption due to residential development, economic growth and transportation belongs to the most serious environmental pressures on landscapes worldwide, in particular in urbanised areas. Accordingly, the aim of containing the development of land is rated increasingly high on the agenda of environmental policy, at least in densely populated countries such as Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands or the UK. As a result, different strategies and instruments to prevent excessive land consumption are being discussed. However, many of these strategies and instruments adopt a rather general approach, while it seems more effective to define the particular areas where the goal of reducing land consumption is to be pursued. Such an approach must draw on information about how detrimental specific land use transitions are with regard to, for instance, the functionality of soils, water balance or habitat quality at specific locations. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for the impact assessment of land use transition in urban areas which highlights how such information can be acquired. This framework includes the differentiation of two levels of impact assessment: the level of the single land unit and the context level which takes into account regional and aggregated impacts of land use transition bound to the spatial context. The conceptual framework provides a basis to disaggregate (supra-)national policy targets regarding land use, to scale them down to the regional level, and thus to clarify the spatially explicit implications of land use policies.

AB  - The integration of land administration processes and the collaboration of land agencies are considered essential for the effective delivery of developable land for housing production. The research upon which this paper is based investigates the interrelationship across land administration functions and between different levels of government in the management and delivery of land for housing production. It focuses on land management policies, land administration processes, and spatial data infrastructure, as they are related to housing production. The study starts from the premise that inadequate integration across land administration functions and between different levels of government impedes land delivery for housing production. Against this background, an assessment framework is proposed as a tool to assess the levels of integration. The parameters for the development of the framework are based on the extensive literature of past and present initiatives which focused on enhancing inter-agency collaboration. It is also supported by interviews with land agencies in the case study areas - Australia and Nigeria - to aggregate the common themes as observed in the literature. The assessment framework was evaluated through selected government departments and agencies. With this approach, the assessment framework develops into the land administration integration assessment matrix. The key consideration of the matrix is to assess the depth of inter-agency relationship ranging from information sharing to consultation, coordination of activities, joint management, partnership arrangement and formal merger of organisations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An increased frequency of droughts is predicted for the Amazon rainforest in the 21st century, which, combined with deforestation, could exacerbate fire occurrence in the region. There is ample evidence of the association between fire use and deforestation in the land use and land cover change (LULCC) processes occurring in the Amazon region, but there are no studies on the actual spatial structuring and spatial association between these events. The present study evaluates the existence of such relationships through the use of remotely sensed data and spatial analysis techniques for an active deforestation frontier covering portions of the states of Rondônia and Mato Grosso in the Brazilian Amazon. A map of burn scars for the year 2005 was produced using a Linear Spectral Mixture Model (LSMM) transformation of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images, with subsequent unsupervised classification and manual editing. Annual and aggregated maps of deforested areas up to 2005, produced by the Brazilian Amazon Deforestation Estimation Project (PRODES), were also used. The amount of burn scar occurrences inside both recent (2002e2005) and old (prior to 2002) deforested areas was then determined, and the spatial structure of both variables was assessed using Mantel tests for multiple aggregation scales. A partial Mantel test was also used to test the spatial correlation between burn scars and deforested areas, accounting for the existence of spatial structure. The results show that there is a significant spatial association between recent deforestation and the occurrence of fires. In addition, we identified a large amount of burned areas (~55%) within older deforested areas. These results highlight the following: 1) the direct role of fire in the land use and land cover change processes in the Brazilian Amazon, and 2) that fire also widely affects previously degraded vegetation, with significant implications for current estimates of forest fire-associated atmospheric carbon emission in the Amazon region. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present review focuses on links between structure, energetics and ion transport in oxygen-deficient perovskite oxides, ABO(3-delta). The perfect long-range order, convenient for interpretations of the structure and properties of ordered materials, is evidently not present in disordered materials and highly defective perovskite oxides are spatially inhomogeneous on an intermediate length scale. Although this makes a fundamental description of these and other disordered materials very difficult, it is becoming increasingly clear that this complexity is often essential for the functional properties. In the present review we advocate a potential energy barrier description of the disordered state in which the possible local (or inherent) structures are seen to correspond to separate local minima on the potential energy surface. We interpret the average structure observed experimentally at any temperature as a time and spatial average of the different local structures which are energetically accessible. The local structure is largely affected by preferences for certain polyhedron coordinations and the oxidation state stability of the transition metals, and the strong long-range electrostatic interactions present in non-stoichiometric oxides imply that only a small fraction of the local energy minima on the potential energy surface are accessible at most temperatures. We will show that models neglecting the spatial inhomogeneity and thus the local structure serve as useful empirical tools for particular purposes, e.g. for understanding the main features of the complex redox properties that are so crucial for many applications of these oxides. The short-range order is on the other hand central for understanding ionic transport. Oxide ion transport involves the transformation of one energetically accessible local structure into another. Thus, strongly correlated transport mechanisms are expected; in addition to the movement of the oxygen ions giving rise to the transport, other ions are involved and even the A and B atoms move appreciably in a cooperative fashion along the transition path. Such strongly correlated or collective ionic migration mechanisms should be considered for fast oxide ion conductors in general and in particular for systems forming superstructures at low temperatures. Structural criteria for fast ion conduction are discussed. A high density of low-lying local energy minima is certainly a prerequisite and for perovskite-related A(2)B(2)O(5) oxides, those containing B atoms that have energetic preference for tetrahedral coordination geometry are especially promising.

AB  - Fire behavior models are an important component of decision support systems for fire management. This paper describes the modeling of two fundamental crown fire behavior features: the onset of crowning and the spread rate of crown fires. The present study is based largely on the database used in the development of the Canadian Forest Fire Behavior Prediction System. The dataset used in the study consisted of 73 experimental fires in various coniferous forest fuel complexes, 40 of which were classified as crown fires. These fires cover a wide spec- trum of fire environment conditions and fire behavior characteristics, with rates of spread rang- ing from 0.5 - 49.4 m/min, and fireline intensity from 62 45,200 kW/m. Crown fire initiation was modeled through a logistic regression approach using 10-m open wind speed, fuel strata gap or height to live crown base, a surface fuel consumption class, and an index of fine dead fuel moisture content as independent variables. Spread rates for active and passive crown fires were modeled through multiple non-linear regression analysis following physical reasoning. Inde- pendent variables used in the crown fire spread models were 10-m open wind speed, canopy bulk density and again the index of fine dead fuel moisture content. The crown fire initiation model correctly predicted 85 % of the cases in the dataset used for its construction. The active crown fire spread model yield a R2 of 0.61. The wide variation in fuel complex structure and fire be- havior in datasets used to build the crown fire initiation and rate of spread models gives confi- dence that the models might work well in fuel complexes different from the original ones, given an adequate description of the physical characteristics of the fuel complex.

AB  - Scenario analysis of urban dynamics from spatial land use models can support urban, planning and policy. An integrated modeling approach, linking assessment of urban spatial dynamics, was applied to the Santiago Metropolitan Area (SMA). The integrated land use change model combines, a logistic regression model, Markov chain, and cellular automata. This model was calibrated with data, from 1975 to 2010, and was used to make predictions for the years 2030 and 2045, using two datasets of, urban and non-urban explanatory variables. Urban change estimates showed the highest fit during the, model calibration phase. The true-positive proportion and standard Kappa value (κ) were of 99% and, 0.87 respectively when validating against an urban cover reference map from 2010. Urban growth was, equal to +27,000. ha (72%) for the period 1975-2010, and the city of Santiago is projected to, reach approximately 93,000. ha by 2045 (+43% from 2010). In the SMA the most important, urban growth pattern is peri-urban development, referring to widespread boundaries and higher, fragmentation in peripheral municipalities. Predictions for 2030 estimate that ~15% of the projected, urban expansion will occur outside the boundary set by the current Regulatory Plan proposal. These, results demonstrate the capacity of the integrated model to establish comparisons with urban plans, and its utility to explain both the amount and constraints of urban growth. The integrated approach of, urban dynamic assessment using land use modeling is useful for spatiotemporal representation of, distinct urban development forms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Assumptions made and results obtained when applying three fire modeling approaches to study three accidental fires that occurred in single-family dwellings are presented  in this article. The modeling approaches used are: a simplified analytical model of fire growth, a zone model (CFAST), and a field model (FDS). The fires predicted are: a house fire of suspected initial location but of unknown ignition source, a small-apartment fire initiated by the ignition of a sofa, which extinguished due to oxygen depletion, and a one-story house fire started by a malfunctioning gas heater.   The input to each model has been kept as independent as possible from the other models while consistent with the forensic evidence. The predictions from the models   of the fires' characteristics are analyzed in the context of the forensic evidence for each accidental fire to compare the models' predictive  capabilities. It is found that in spite of the differences in the sophistication of these three modeling approaches, the results are in relatively good agreement,  particularly in the early stages of the fire. Simpler models can be used as a first step towards less approximate modeling or to confirm the order of magnitude of the results from more complex models. The results of this study can be used to reach conclusions about the complexity of the model required to describe a particular fire scenario.

AB  - Marginal land provides an alternative potential for food and bioenergy production in the face of limited land resources; however, effective assessment of marginal lands is not well addressed. Concerns over environmental risks, ecosystem services and sustainability for marginal land have been widely raised. The objective of this study was to develop a hierarchical marginal land assessment framework for land use planning and management. We first identified major land functions linking production, environment, ecosystem services and economics, and then classified land resources into four categories of marginal land using suitability and limitations associated with major management goals, including physically marginal land, biologically marginal land, environmentally ecologically marginal land, and economically marginal land. We tested this assessment framework in southwestern Michigan, USA. Our results indicated that this marginal land assessment framework can be potentially feasible on land use planning for food and bioenergy production, and balancing multiple goals of land use management. We also compared our results with marginal land assessment from the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and land capability classes (LCC) that are used in the US. The hierarchical assessment framework has advantages of quantitatively reflecting land functions and multiple concerns. This provides a foundation upon which focused studies can be identified in order to improve the assessment framework by quantifying high-resolution land functions associated with environment and ecosystem services as well as their criteria needed to improve the assessment framework. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic methodology to derive land-use classes from a remotely sensed data derived land cover map at a scale of 1:200,000. The aim of the study is to better understand the land cover/land-use relationship and to enhance the value of a land cover mapping product for the planning and management of natural resources and/or environmental change studies. In the case of the study, the land cover product is generated using the FAO/UNEP “land cover classification system”. The methodology is heavily determined by the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery, the classification system used and the expert knowledge of the study area. For any given land cover the associated land-uses are identified as well as the land cover/land-use relationship. It is assumed that these relations can be of four types: one to one, one to many, many to one or a combination of any of the aforementioned possibilities. The land cover/land-use relation need not be consistent across the study area. The parameters used for land-use classification are based on a comprehensive review of the literature, in which land cover and land-use are usually amalgamated. A set of decision rules was established to define land-use classes. These decision rules were tested during the field survey, after which they were applied to the whole study area. The concurrence of land cover and land-use delineations is discussed for the classes identified. The result of the study is a detailed, flexible land-use data set in which the various parameters used for classification can be re-grouped according to user needs.

AB  - Abstract: The acceleration of processes such as forest fragmentation and forest fires in landscapes under intense human pressures makes it imperative to quantify and understand the effects of these processes on the conservation of biodiversity in these landscapes. We combined information from remote-sensing imagery and ground maps of all fires in the Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary (MWLS) in the Western Ghats of India over 14 years (1989-2002). These spatial data on fire occurrence were integrated with maps of vegetation types found in the MWLS to examine fire conditions in each. We calculated the average fire-return interval for each of the vegetation types individually and for the MWLS as a whole. Using vegetation data from the larger Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve and the entire Western Ghats region, we conservatively estimated fire-frequency information for these larger regions. Because the MWLS does not contain tropical evergreen or montane forests, we were unable to estimate fire conditions in these forest types, which represent 31% of all Western Ghats vegetation cover. For the MWLS, all vegetation types had average fire-return intervals of <7 years, and the sanctuary as a whole had a fire-return interval of 3.3 years. Compared with a 13-year MWLS fire data set from 1909-1921, this represents a threefold increase in fire frequency over the last 80 years. We estimated average fire-return intervals of roughly 5 years for both the larger Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve and the entire Western Ghats region. Given other recent reports, the estimated fire frequencies for the Western Ghats forests outside protected reserves are conservative. We conclude that the current fire regime of the Western Ghats poses a severe and persistent conservation threat to forests both within and outside protected reserves.

AB  - While there is an important body of research on environmental discourses and policy in Southeast Asia, the situation in the Lao PDR remains understudied. This paper builds on debates related to environmental change and knowledge production and examines the socio-political construction of the current mainstream discourse on land degradation in Laos. It highlights that, despite significant uncertainties as regard the extent and severity of the issue, land degradation in the uplands is represented by the Laotian authorities and many of their development partners as a major and imminent threat to the development of the country. The paper also examines the way this perspective is translated into policies specifically aimed at resolving the upland issue and proposes an alternative reading of this process where mainstream discourse and associated policy appear partly shaped by the subjectivities and political economic projects of Laos' policy-makers. Finally, drawing on the case of Laos, the paper provides a critical reflection on conventional approaches to assessing socio-environmental issues and defining policy interventions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Measurements have been made of the rate of fire spread in a solid fuel array consisting of horizontal paper strips standing on edge, separated by various amounts of space. It is found that ignition transients show evidence of several burning modes and in some cases the steady burning can also occur in two different ways, at different speeds. The steady spread rate correlates with the height spacing ratio for both low and high values, but not for intermediate values. The available fire-spread theories are shown to be self consistent in the sense that the predicted relationship between various measured quantities is verified. However, the absence of the possibility of prediction of burning-zone properties, prevents the prediction of fire-spread rate from first principles. © 1971 Combustion Institute.

AB  - The interaction of fires, where one fire burns into another recently burned area, is receiving increased attention from scientists and land managers wishing to describe the role of fire scars in affecting landscape pattern and future fire spread. Here, we quantify fire-on-fire interactions in terms of frequency, size, and time-since-previous fire (TSPF) in three large wilderness areas in Montana and Idaho, USA, from 1984 to present, using spatially consistent large fire perimeter data from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) dataset. The analysis is supplemented with less consistent fire perimeter data from a regional fire atlas in order to examine the potential role played by smaller fires in fire-on-fire interactions. We compare current rates of burning to existing estimates using the natural fire rotation (NFR) to determine whether recent fire activity falls within established historical ranges. We also compare actual fires to randomly located fires to establish whether the frequency and size of re-burns differ by chance. Finally, we systematically classify shared fire edges as fire-stopping or breached to quantify the effect of previous fires on subsequent fire spread. In total, more than half of the Frank Church, one-quarter of the Bob Marshall, and fifteen percent of the Selway-Bitterroot wilderness areas have burned since 1984. Area burned within each of the study areas yielded NFRs that are consistent with results derived from fire atlas and tree-ring research studies. The data show that reburning occurs less frequently than chance in the Frank Church Wilderness Area, perhaps less frequently in the Bob Marshall Wilderness Area, and the same as chance in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area. In each of the study areas, the total amount of edge at which a fire met another fire was less than three percent of the total available perimeter. However, ~80 % of the total edge encountered was breached, resulting in fire spreading onto previously burned landscapes and re-burning at least 40 ha. Year-to-year variability in re-burn occurrence was high, and the size of re-burns was typically small, implying a general resistance to re-burning, but the preponderance of small patches resulting from fire interactions has perhaps significant ecological implications. There was a systematic decrease in the frequency of small to medium sized re-burns (40 ha to 405 ha) as time between fires increased in all three wilderness areas. The frequency of large re-burns in- creased with time in the Frank Church wilderness area, but this trend was not apparent in the other two wilderness areas. Overall, fire-on-fire interactions show a high degree of complexity, making direct comparisons between the three wilderness areas difficult, but the evidence suggests that large wildfires generally inhibit the spread of subsequent fires, while small fires appear to have little impact on the spread of other fires. The limiting effect of large fires on small fires is potentially significant based on the number of cases observed (n = 101).

AB  - Large fire events in southern California have burned thousands of hectares over the past decade. Landscape pattern and natural system processes are shaped by these large conflagrations, thereby influencing the ecological structure and functioning of the region. Unburned vegetation remnants can be used to assess general fuel consumption and to provide valuable information regarding fire behaviour, weather effects and post-fire regeneration. For this study, post-fire unburned vegetation was mapped at a very fine spatial resolution based on semi-automatic classification of airborne large-format multispectral image data and compared across different fire environment zones within the 2003 Cedar Fire burn perimeter. Landscape metrics were used to characterise unburned vegetation patches for a section of the Cedar Fire affected by Santa Ana weather conditions and for a section of the fire that burned under non-Santa Ana weather conditions. Maps of remnant vegetation and associated landscape metrics were compared across these two sections and within shrubland community type, topography and age-class strata using inferential statistics. Key findings reveal more unburned vegetation in larger, rounder patches in the non-Santa Ana section. Pre-fire stand age greater than 6 years showed little effect on the amount or pattern of unburned vegetation within the Santa Ana section. © 2010 IAWF.

A key innovation of the UPTown game developed at the University of Pretoria, South Africa, is the way in which the actions of both public-sector planners and private-sector real estate developers are simulated by students. This allows students to explore the problems of conflicting objectives and to discover the value of cooperative planning in the land use and transportation development process. The paper describes the background to and rationale for an integrated planning course, and it explains the game and simulation aspects in detail. Assessment of student performance showed that the game significantly enhanced the achievement of learning outcomes. Students who faced more complex and open-ended tasks performed better, reaching higher levels of competence earlier on in the game. The paper should be of value to educators who wish to develop new approaches, such as gaming simulation, to respond to contemporary engineering students' preferences for more active and social learning styles.

AB  - Because it is the post-mining land-use that prescribes the methods, the measures and the costs of mine reclamation, a major implicit goal of mine reclamation is to determine an after-use option. Therefore, there should be an analytical approach to optimize the determination of post-mining land-use. A Mined Land Suitability Analysis (MLSA) framework, which had been previously derived from reclamation practice reports of mines and other disturbed lands, is used in combination with two Multi-Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) techniques to provide the required analytical approach. In the proposed approach the decision makers consist of the most related experts and the identified stakeholders. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is used to determine global weights of MLSA framework attributes via pair-wise comparison matrixes composed by each individual expert. Once the global weight vector of the attributes is calculated using AHP, they are incorporated into the decision matrices composed by stakeholders and passed to the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), which is a distance-based MADM technique and is used to determine preference order of post-mining land uses. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents an operational approach to predicting fire growth for wildland fires in Canada. The approach addresses data assimilation to provide predictions in a timely and efficient manner. Fuels and elevation grids, forecast weather, and active fire locations are entered into a fire-growth model; then predicted fire perimeters are mapped and presented on the web. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA/AVHRR) satellite-based detection systems are used to detect current wildland fires (referred to as hotspots). For selected regions, fire-growth simulation environments are assembled. Fuel type data from several fire management agencies are available in grid format at a resolution of 100 m or less; in areas where such data are not available, a national fuels map based on Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre Vegetation sensor (SPOT VGT) land cover and forest inventory is used. Similarly, terrain data are available from a variety of sources. Current hotspots are used as ignition points while past hotspots are used to delineate area burned. Surface wind, temperature, and dew-point values (forecast by Environment Canada) are used to determine the fire weather conditions at the fire location. A case study of two large fires in Canada consisting of 54 fire simulation days is used to test these hypotheses. © 2009 IAWF.

The algorithms for simulating the fire spread process in buildings and calculating dynamic probability of fire spread for each compartment at each time step of simulation are proposed. The formulae used in calculating the input data for the dynamic fire spread model are derived. The dynamic fire spread model can easily be applied for any building including high-rise buildings. A detailed example of calculation of fire spread in a two-storey office building is described. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper is devoted to the improvement of semi-physical fire spread models. In order to improve them, a theoretical approach based on the multiphase concept was carried out. The multiphase approach which considers the finest physical phenomena involved in fire behaviour was reduced by making several assumptions. This work led us to a simplified set of equations. Among these, a single equation for the thermal balance was obtained by using the thermal equilibrium hypothesis. This approach has been applied to the improvement of our semi-physical model in order to take into account increasing wind influence. The predictions of the improved model were then compared to experimental data obtained for fire spread conducted across pine needle fuel beds. To this end, different slope values and varying wind velocities were considered. The experimental tendency for the variation of the rate of spread was predicted. Indeed, it increases with increasing wind velocity for a given slope as well as for a given wind with increasing slope.

AB  - Two basic models of community support for the adoption of land use controls have been developed. One model is based upon the sociological theory of innovation diffusion while the other comes from the economic theory of market failure. The relationship of each of these models to the constitutional legitimacy of land use regulation in the USA is significant, and the models may provide a theoretical framework for judicial decision making in cases where property owners affected by controls demand compensation under the taking clause of the US Constitution.

AB  - Although resprouting is recognized as a key post-disturbance response for plants, few studies have closely examined post-fire growth responses of resprouting species. Following a prescribed burn in Florida scrub, we compared intraspecific and interspecific growth patterns of 16 resprouting shrub species. We then examined how resprouting growth is related to species life history strategies to understand how the resprouting response could contribute to niche differentiation and species coexistence. We defined growth by calculating relative growth rates based on height, crown area, and crown volume of resprouts. In addition, we measured the number, diameter, and height of all resprouting stems. The number and diameter of all stems present before fire were also estimated. The number of resprouting stems after the fire was higher than the number of stems present before the fire for all species. As expected, species varied significantly in their post-fire growth rates, especially between those with differing recovery modes. Resprouting shrubs that are also post-fire seeders had the lowest growth rates compared to those that resprout and grow clonally, those that only resprout, and palmettos. We also found differences in post-fire growth among species with different growth forms, with palmettos having the fastest growth, followed by shrubs, and then by sub-shrubs. Within species, tradeoffs were found between height and the density of new stems, but not between height and diameter of resprouting stems. Overall, Florida scrub species exhibit a continuum of post-fire growth rates, suggesting the coexistence of a number of successful strategies for post-fire resprouting rather than a single optimal recovery strategy.

AB  - Recent high intensity wildfires and our demonstrated inability to control extreme fire behavior suggest a need for alternative approaches for preventing wildfire disasters. Current fire spread models are not sufficiently based on a basic understanding of fire spread processes to provide more effective management alternatives. An experimental and theoretical approach for improved understanding is necessary particularly for shrub and tree canopy fuels. Preliminary experiments of radiation heating resulted in coarse fuels (12-mm cross-section) heating to ignition while fine fuels (1-mm cross-section) did not. These results generally agree with other prior research results and indicate that radiation heating may not be sufficent for ignition. This study and our associated research will continue with the goal of developing a physical fuel particle ignition model as a basis for appropriate fire spread modeling assumptions.

AB  - Good governance is increasingly recognized as critical to effective development. Governments with a record of transparency, accountability and responsiveness are far more likely to attract investment, provide high-quality public services and manage resources more cost-effectively than those which activities are opaque and not open to public scrutiny. Corruption may breed where government officials have discretion without accountability, especially in government agencies involved in provision of services to the public including land, health and education. Experience suggests that governments typically do not welcome public scrutiny. While there are many examples of governments opening themselves to the public through mechanisms such as freedom of information laws, and others have adopted well-publicized anti-corruption programs, sometimes under external pressure from donors, the record of supply-side reform has often had mixed results. Previously, insufficient attention has been given in land-related development cooperation to the integration of good governance and safeguards in the design, implementation and impact monitoring of land administration and management projects. The emphasis has been on establishing first-time property rights and building capacity, especially within the civil service. Further emphasis has been in the areas of policy reform, institutional development and new technology. However, it is only more recently, as increasing attention to issues of accountability and transparency, and indeed corruption, which have been consistently raised by civil society organizations (CSOs) and non-government organizations (NGOs), that attention has been turned to governance. Good governance is fundamental to achieving the benefits of the protection of property rights and the development of efficient and effective land and property markets. In addition, good governance is essential for the efficient and effective stewardship of the environment and natural resources. Good governance in land administration is not a new issue, and

AB  - It’s well known that most taxonomists become taxonomists by accident, as the title of my book attests. As I look back on my career, I see this progression continuing one step further in accidentally becoming a taxonomy consultant.Not all consultants are accidental, though. Bright college graduates in the social sciences with strong analytical skills are often attracted to entry level jobs at consulting firms. They then pick up technical consulting skills by practice over time, and these could even involve taxonomy work. As such, they are not accidental consultants, but they may become accidental taxonomy consultants.Those who are already taxonomists, as myself, often end up as consultants, because that’s where they find the work. Full-time taxonomist jobs are still relatively rare and are often not in one’s geographical location. So, if an experienced taxonomist loses a job due to a layoff or relocation, and looks around and cannot find another conveniently located taxonomist job, consulting becomes an option. Employers of full-time taxonomists tend to be limited to either certain industries (publishing, media, ecommerce, etc.) or to very large companies in any industry with large internal content management needs, but then the taxonomist job is only at their headquarters location. However, companies of all industries and various medium to large sizes have taxonomy needs and can often afford a taxonomy consultant on a temporary project if not a full-time staff member. Thus, taxonomy consultants are in greater demand than are full-time employed taxonomists.In seeking to contract a taxonomy consultant, you may wonder whether it is better to hire a consultant-turned-taxonomist or a taxonomist-turned-consultant. If you hire a skilled taxonomist who is less experienced in consulting, you ought to get a good taxonomy, although the process might not be that smooth. More likely, though, the experienced taxonomist who is inexperienced in consulting will not likely make as good a first impression and sell the services as well as professional consultant. The professional consultant-turned-taxonomist will provide a better project experience, although the end-result taxonomy may not be as good. If you can plan and manage the project yourself, then it is the experienced taxonomist you want, but if you want the entire project managed by a consultant, you need a good consultant.You might not have to compromise, though. A senior enough consultant could be sufficiently skilled in both consulting and taxonomies, that the career sequence does not matter. If you can afford to hire a firm or partnership, or even a consultant with subcontractors, you may not need to make the choice of experience either, because you can hopefully get some of each on the consultant team serving you. That’s why you should look at the resumes of each member of a consulting team, to ensure that at least one member has very solid taxonomy experience, while at least another member has considerable consulting and project management experience.Among the things I have learned about consulting is that it helps to have standard consulting processes and procedures, including standard questions that the consultant should ask the client at the very beginning of a project to clarify the scope and understand the context. Consulting firms may additionally have standard deliverables, reports, etc. But in the particular field of taxonomy consulting, the variables are too great, and standard deliverables rarely fit.There are a lot of books on consulting, but none about taxonomy consulting. When I came across a potential title, Information Consulting: Guide to Good PracticeI (Chandos Publishing, 2011), I found that even this book addressed consulting more generally, and when it occasionally discussed “information consulting” it was more about the work of independent research librarians. So, accidental taxonomy consultants lack written guidance that is just for them.This is my story. I became a taxonomist by accident. Then after getting laid off, more than once, I became a taxonomy consultant by accident. Then I joined a consulting company of intentional consultants, some turned taxonomy-consultant by accident, but I did not feel I fit in with them or their choice of projects, since I was a taxonomist first. So, I recently chose to go on my own again as an independent consultant or partnering with another on a case-by-case basis.

AB  - Forest fire managers have long understood that most of a fire's growth typically occurs on a small number of days when burning conditions are conducive for spread. Fires either grow very slowly at low intensity or burn considerable area in a 'run'. A simple classification of days into 'spread events' and 'non-spread events' can greatly improve estimates of area burned. Studies with fire-growth models suggest that the Canadian Forest Fire Behaviour Prediction System (FBP System) seems to predict growth well during high-intensity 'spread events' but tends to overpredict rate of spread for non-spread events. In this study, we provide an objective weather-based definition of 'spread events', making it possible to assess the probability of having a spread event on any particular day. We demonstrate the benefit of incorporating this 'spread event' day concept into a fire-growth model based on the Canadian FBP System.

AB  - This paper presents a system dynamics approach to simultaneous land use/transportation system performance modeling. A model is designed based on the causality functions and feedback loop structure between a large number of physical, socioeconomic, and policy variables. The model system consists of 7 sub-models: population, migration of population, household, job growth-employment-land availability, housing development, travel demand, and traffic congestion level. The model is formulated in DYNAMO simulation language, and tested on a data set from Montgomery County, MD. In Part I: Methodology, the overall approach and the structure of the model system is discussed and the causal-loop diagrams and major equations are presented. In Part II: Application, the model is calibrated and tested with data from Montgomery County, MD. Least square method and overall system behavior are used to estimate the model parameters. The model is fitted with the 1970-80 data and validated with the 1980-1990 data. Robustness and sensitivities with respect to input parameters such as birth rate or regional economy growth are analyzed. The model performance as a policy analysis tool is also examined by predicting the year by year impacts of highway capacity expansion on land use and transportation system performance. While this is a first attempt in using dynamic system simulation modeling in simultaneous treatment of land use and transportation system interactions, and model development and application are limited to some extent due to data availability, the results clearly indicate that the proposed method is a promising approach in dealing with complex urban land use/transportation modeling.

AB  - Fire spread models have a long history, and their use will continue to grow as they evolve from a research tool to an operational tool. This paper describes a new method to analyse two-dimensional fire spread modeling errors, particularly to quantify the uncertainties of fire spread predictions. Measures of error are defined from the respective spread distances of the actual and simulated fires at specified points around their perimeters. A ratio error provides a correction factor for the spread model bias. The characteristics of the error are defined by a probability model, which is used to construct error bounds on fire spread predictions. The method is applied to the Bee Fire, which burned 3848 ha on the San Bernardino National Forest, California, in summer 1996. The study focused on the early, presuppression stages of the fire. A mesoscale spectral model was used to simulate weather conditions on a grid interval of 2 km. The FARSITE system was used to simulate fire growth during the first 105 min of the fire. The case study showed how difficult fire spread modeling is under the conditions presented by the Bee Fire.

AB  - This article presents a series of experiments on benchmark fire suppression. The experiments were performed in a controlled environment, utilizing a cylindrical object or calorimeter centered above a 2m diameter pan filled with kerosene-based hydrocarbon fuel, JP8. The experimental setup and procedure for gathering data on water suppression performance are presented. The characteristics of the nozzles used in the experiments are presented as well. The experimental results provide the boundary condition and temporal data necessary for validation of the fire suppression models used. The article also includes simulation results on the fire suppression experimental tests. The suppression simulations were carried out using a numerical model based on a Temporally Filtered Navier-Stokes (TFNS) formulation coupled with a Lagrangian model for droplets, which includes detailed descriptions of the interaction between the water droplets and the fire plume. The results from both experiments and simulations suggest that the criterion for complete suppression depends on a combination of factors including the mass flow rate (or nozzle diameter), nozzle operating pressure, and calorimeter presence. A critical regime which distinguished the regions of suppression and no-suppression in the domain of the mass flow rate versus operating pressure is found.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic methodology to derive land-use classes from a remotely sensed data derived land cover map at a scale of 1:200,000. The aim of the study is to better understand the land cover/land-use relationship and to enhance the value of a land cover mapping product for the planning and management of natural resources and/or environmental change studies. In the case of the study, the land cover product is generated using the FAO/UNEP &quot;land cover classification system&quot;. The methodology is heavily determined by the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery, the classification system used and the expert knowledge of the study area. For any given land cover the associated land-uses are identified as well as the land cover/land-use relationship. It is assumed that these relations can be of four types: one to one, one to many, many to one or a combination of any of the aforementioned possibilities. The land cover/land-use relation need not be consistent across the study area. The parameters used for land-use classification are based on a comprehensive review of the literature, in which land cover and land-use are usually amalgamated. A set of decision rules was established to define land-use classes. These decision rules were tested during the field survey, after which they were applied to the whole study area. The concurrence of land cover and land-use delineations is discussed for the classes identified. The result of the study is a detailed, flexible land-use data set in which the various parameters used for classification can be re-grouped according to user needs.

AB  - This paper presents a holistic method by integrating three concepts (land resources management, assets supervision and political governance for sustainability) for investigation of land administration in China, taking into consideration of cultivated land protection for a testimony with econometric method. Theoretically, in this self-organizing integrated method, land resources management focuses on the productivity of land; land assets supervision centralizes on the realization of land usufruct rights in land transference; land political governance for sustainability concentrates on harmonious linkage of economic efficiency, social stability and environmental safety of land use. Their interrelations are complex. Methodologically, the results indicate that the theoretical model is feasible to explain variations of cultivated land protection with these three concepts. Cultivated land decreases with increasing land value increment multiples, and is positive with political governance concept, but not in a linear fashion. Finally the results suggest that roles of government in land administration need to be changed and strengthened, supporting complete compensation for land expropriation and modification to policies of cultivated land. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land use and land cover are important determinants of the state of the natural environment. As a result, measures of land use and land cover change have been widely used as indicators of environmental condition and quality. This review explores the range of measures that have been applied in the UK at national, regional and local scales, and their sensitivity to particular drivers of change. The extent to which these indicators are important properties in themselves or are surrogates for wider environmental qualities is considered. The discussion focuses on the evolving frameworks used to analyse the relationships between land use and the state of the natural environment. The limitations and strengths of the DPSIR reporting and analytical framework are explored. Recent approaches to the assessment of the impacts of future land use change on the natural environment using model-based scenario methods are examined, and the need to develop new types of aggregate measure of land use function is identified. There is also a pressing need to link assessments of trends to the analysis of sustainability thresholds or limits. It is concluded that the concept of a socio-ecological system offers a more fruitful approach to the analysis of the relationships between land use and the state of the natural environment than the simplistic cause-effect models that have been used in the past. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Based on technical recommendations and fieldwork, we defined ranges of wind speed, relative humidity and rainfall that are needed for burning. We studied how these conditions varied over periods of 10 to 50+ years based on meteorological records in 5 locations. Participant observation of agricultural burns and interviews with community leaders and government officials allowed us to study the challenges of following regulations. Results indicate that during the legal time to burn, from 4 to 11. am, there is, on average, only 1. h with suitable climate conditions for agricultural fire. Farmers burn in the afternoon, when moisture is lower, increasing the chances of successful agricultural burns to 25% and up to 80% compared to morning conditions. However, in the afternoon, wind speed tends to increase, elevating the likelihood of uncontrolled secondary fires. In terms of seasonality, the period to burn is suitable for some years in some locations but it is not infallible. Environmental rules aimed at fire management must be sensitive to local climate variations in order to achieve both wildfire prevention and support livelihood systems relying on fire. Rules that do not correspond to the physical context are not only less likely to be followed, but are not legitimate to actors whose behaviors are intended to be regulated. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A postal survey of company car drivers was carried out to compare the accident liability of these drivers with data from an earlier survey of 'ordinary' drivers; 4479 usable questionnaires were returned. On average, company drivers cover much more than twice as many miles as ordinary drivers, and their overall reported accident frequency was 0.19 accidents per driver per year. A multivariate model was used to relate accidents to mileage and other variables such as age and experience of the driver. Accident frequency increase with mileage, but not in direct proportion to mileage and falls with age and experience. The comparison with the earlier survey showed that company car drivers have about 50% more accidents than ordinary drivers after allowing for their higher mileages. When the company car driver data was examined on its own, those who drove more than one car during their work had significantly fewer accidents; in addition there was a strong indication that those drivers who had been offered a reward for not having an accident, also had fewer accidents. 11% of the company car drivers had taken car driver training since passing the L-test; the difference between the accident liability of drivers that had received training and those that had not (-8%) was not statistically significant.

AB  - Fire detection and monitoring sensors, fire modelling, fire fighting and command and control are usually perceived as independent issues within fire safety. Sensor data is associated to detection and alarm and to some minor extent as a source of very basic information for building management or emergency response. The streams of data emerging from sensors are deemed to lead to a rapid information overload, so the pervasive sensor deployment (now common in modern buildings) is entirely independent of procedures associated to emergency management. Fire modelling follows a similar path because model output is not robust enough, not fast enough and the information generated by such simulations rapidly escalates in quantity and complexity so that no commander can assimilate it. Fire fighting is therefore left as an isolated activity that does not benefit much from sensor data or the potential of modelling the event. This separation is naturally induced by the complexity of a fire event and represents the biggest barrier to the useful development of sensor technology and fire modelling into emergency response. Therefore, current technology applied to fire is decades behind sensor development for other related areas like military operations or intruder security. There is no apparent use for more complex and expensive sensors. This paper describes the different processes that need to be studied to establish a path by which a collection of sensor data can be used to provide early detection, robust building management and adequate information to assist fire fighting operations.

AB  - Support needed for agriculture in developing countries has been eroded in the belief that agriculture threatens biodiversity. Preference is now given to environmental research and conservation. Yet there is increasing evidence that much of the ecological criticism of agriculture in developing countries is unfounded. Using the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) as a framework, this paper questions the use of ecological 'received wisdom' in international agri-environmental policy over the past 10 years and puts forward a case for productive agriculture and conservation through common-sense land use policies. The paper identifies and then focuses on 'received wisdom' surrounding the two CBD objectives of conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. It presents evidence to question and then reject three major 'received wisdom' propositions, namely: the ecosystem approach; the idea that agricultural expansion damages wild biodiversity; and that agricultural biodiversity ensures agricultural sustainability. The paper suggests that future emphasis in the CBD process should be given to three biodiversity-friendly services that agriculture can provide: agricultural intensification to allow land-saving for conserving wild biodiversity off-farm; fields as sustainable models of non-equilibrium ecosystems; and the greater use of the extensive knowledge base generated by agricultural research for developing sound ecological approaches to managing biodiversity. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The land administration system in the Philippines can be aptly described into two words: multiple and complex. The whole system has been governed by multiple laws, regulations, processes and standards, and has been managed by multiple institutions with limited collaboration. These inherent flaws have been largely attributed to the dual process of land titling and registration—administrative and judicial. This time- consuming and expensive process has not encouraged a “culture of registration” hence a large share of the country’s real estate sector remained undocumented. The inefficiency in the land administration system has become a disincentive to investment in the land market because of the high transaction costs in securing, registering and transferring property rights. Moreover, the complicated land institutions and processes have further strained limited public sector budget due to unnecessary duplications in management and administration support, and land information and records.

Also studied was how the exits were perceived and the results were interpreted using the theory of affordances. The results indicate that green flashing lights can be used to influence exit choice in the event of a fire emergency. However, the effectiveness of the system seems to depend on the setting, e.g., the type of building. The results suggest that green flashing lights at an emergency exit, if used in an appropriate setting, makes the exit stand out and encourages people to use it.

AB  - This special issue consists of 10 papers that aim at deriving sustainability indicators based on the concept of socioeconomic metabolism. Its focus is on indicators that relate socioeconomic metabolism to land use. Six of the papers focus on methods to derive indicators. Of these, four examine approaches and applications of ecological footprints, one considers the 'material and energy flow accounting' toolbox that also includes human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP), and another one considers an approach for comparing the sustainability of landscapes based on remotely sensed GIS data. Two papers focus on conceptual and theoretical issues that are common to a number of tools: one discusses basic conceptual issues of observing progress towards sustainability, whereas the other compares basic conceptual considerations and research questions driving HANPP on the one hand, and the ecological footprint on the other. Three papers present case studies, two on Austria and one compares three countries (Austria, South Korea and the Philippines) to the global level. One paper uses broad empirical datasets to test hypotheses on the relations between HANPP and landscape structure.

AB  - Devices in modern technologies often have complex architectures, dissimilar\nmaterials, and small features. Their long-term reliability relates\nto inelastic, time-dependent mechanical behavior of such structures.\nThis paper analyzes a three-layer structure consisting of, from top\nto bottom, an elastic film, a power-law creep underlayer, and a rigid\nsubstrate. The layers are bonded. Initially, the film is subject\nto a uniform biaxial tensile stress. A channel crack is introduced\nin the elastic film. As the underlayer creeps, the stress field in\nthe film relaxes in the crack wake, but intensifies around the crack\ntip. We formulate nonlinear diffusion-like equations that evolve\nthe displacement field. When the crack is stationary, the region\nin which the stress field relaxes increases with time. We identify\nthe length scale of the region as a function of time. The stress\nintensity factor is proportional to the square-root of the length\nscale. For the power-law creep underlayer, this newly identified\nlength depends on the film stress, and corrects an error in a previous\npaper by Huang, Prevost and Suo (Acta Materialia 50, 4137, 2002).\nWhen the crack advances, its velocity can reach a steady state. We\nidentify the scaling law for the steady velocity. An extended finite\nelement method (X-FEM) is used to simultaneously evolve the creep\nstrain and crack length. Numerical results are presented for the\nstress intensity factors of stationary cracks, and the steady velocities\nof advancing cracks.

We also attempt to model specific fire suppression tactics based on air tanker attacks utilising technical specifications as well as operational capabilities of the aircrafts. We use the detailed model to approximate the dynamics of a large-scale fire that broke out in a region on the west flank of the Greek National Park of Parnitha Mountain in June of 2007. The comparison between the simulation and the actual results showed that the proposed model predicts the fire-spread characteristics in an adequate manner.

AB  - Many fuel beds, especially live vegetation canopies (conifer forests, shrub fields, bunch-grasses) contain gaps between vegetation clumps. Fires burning in these fuel types often display thresholds for spread that are observed to depend on environmental factors like wind, slope, and fuel moisture content. To investigate threshold spread behaviours, we conducted a set of laboratory burn experiments in artificial fuel beds where gap structure, depth, and slope were controlled. Results revealed that fire spread was limited by gap distance and that the threshold distance for spread was increased for deeper fuel beds and steeper slopes. The reasons for this behaviour were found using a high-speed thermal camera. Flame movements recorded by the camera at 120 Hz suggested fuel particles experience intermittent bathing of non-steady flames before ignition and that fuel particles across the gap ignited only after direct flame contact. The images also showed that the flame profile within the fuel bed expands with height, producing greater horizontal flame displacement in deeper beds. Slope, thus, enhances spread by increasing the effective depth in the uphill direction, which produces wider flames, and thereby increases the potential flame contact. This information suggests that fire spread across discontinuous fuel beds is dependent on the vertical flame profile geometry within the fuel bed and the statistical properties of flame characteristics.

AB  - To address climate change, many U.S. states are taking action to establish policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in all economic sectors. With the transportation sector contributing 28 percent of national greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in 2006, strategies to mitigate transportation sector emissions are an important component of state's climate action plans. This paper summarizes the transportation and land use approaches that states have included in their climate action plans to date. Transportation and land use sector options are generally organized into three main categories: vehicle technology, fuels, and travel activity/land use. This paper adds a fourth category: vehicle operations to acknowledge that important mitigation options include how drivers operate their vehicles. Annual greenhouse gas reduction potential in 2012 and 2020 and cost effectiveness values are provided. The information in this paper provides a starting-point for transportation practitioners to use when initiating their own evaluations of greenhouse gas mitigation options at the regional, state, or local level.

AB  - SUMMARY: LINQ is the project name for a set of extensions to the .NET Framework that provide a generic approach to querying data from different data sources. LINQ will premier in Visual Studio 2008, and will become the next musthave skill for .NET developers. For more information about LINQ, you can check out the authorrs"s portal at www.linqdev.com .Pro LINQ: Language Integrated Query in C 2008 is all about code.Literally, this book starts with code and ends with code. In most books, the author shows the simplest example demonstrating how to use a method, but they so rarely show how to use the more complex prototypes. Pro LINQ: Language Integrated Query in C 2008 is different. Demonstrating the overwhelming majority of LINQ operators and protoypes, it is a veritable treasury of LINQ examples.Rather than obscure the relevant LINQ principles in code examples by focusing on a demonstration application you have no interest in writing, Pro LINQ: Language Integrated Query in C 2008 cuts right to the chase of each LINQ operator, method, or class. However, where complexity is necessary to truly demonstrate an issue, the examples are right there in the thick of it. For example, code samples demonstrating how to handle concurrency conflicts actually create concurrency conflicts so you can step through the code and see them unfold.Most books tell you about the simple stuff, while few books warn you of the pitfalls. Where Pro LINQ: Language Integrated Query in C 2008 returns your investment is in the hours, and sometimes days, spent by the author determining why something may not work as expected. Sometimes this results in an innocent looking paragraph that may take you a minute to read and understand, but took days to research and explain.Face it, most technical books while informative, are dull. LINQ need not be dull. Written with a sense of humor, Pro LINQ: Language Integrated Query in C 2008 will attempt to entertain you on your journey through the wonderland of LINQ and C 2008. What yours"ll learn How to leverage all the new LINQ relevant C 2008 language features including extension methods, lambda expressions, anonymous data types, and partial methods. How to use LINQ to Objects to query inmemory data collections such as arrays, ArrayLists, and Lists to retrieve the data you want. Why some queries are deferred, how a deferred query can bite you, and how you can make deferred queries work for you. How to use LINQ to XML to revolutionize your creation, manipulation, and searching of XML data. How to query DataSets with LINQ to DataSet so you can coexist with legacy code and use LINQ to query databases other than SQL Server. How to query Databases with LINQ to SQL, write your own entity classes, and understand how to handle concurrency conflicts. Who is this book for?This book is written for the proficient C developer, but you do not need to be up on all the latest C features to understand the material. When you finish this book, you will be up on all the latest C features.

AB  - A new methodology to effectively forecast fire dynamics based on assimilation of sensor observations is presented and demonstrated. An inverse modelling approach with a two-zone model is used to forecast the growth of a compartment fire. Sensor observations are assimilated into the model in order to estimate invariant parameters and thus speed up simulations and recover information lost by modelling approximations. A series of cases of a compartment fire radially spreading at different growth rates (slow, medium and fast) are used to test the methodology. Spread rate, entrainment coefficient and smoke transport time are the invariant parameters estimated via a gradient-based optimization method with tangent linear differentiation. The parameters were estimated accurately within minutes after ignition and the heat release rate reproduced satisfactorily in all cases. Moreover, the temperature and the height of the hot layer are forecasted with a positive lead time between 50 and 80 s, depending on the fire growth rate. The results show that the simple mass and energy conservation equations and plume correlation of the zone model are suitable to forecast the main features of a growing fire. Positive lead times are reported here for the first time in fire dynamics. The results also suggest the existence of an optimal width for the assimilation window. The proposed methodology is subject to ongoing research and the results are an important step towards the forecast of fire dynamics to lead the emergency response. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - The issue of fire scenarios approach to fire protection is often subject of ongoing discussions within the fire safety engineering community. The choice of an adequate number and type of fire scenarios is not always univocal and straightforward. The fire scenarios to be used in structural assessment are quite complicated to obtain. Their definition often involves significant large-scale fire tests and sophisticated numerical simulations, taking into account numerous factors. For this reason, it seems appropriate to introduce probabilistic tools to assess the most probable fire scenarios. This work proposes a probabilistic approach integrating the Monte Carlo simulation with plastic limit analysis in order to assess the probability of failure of a structure subjected to fire. The underlying assumptions related to spatial-temporal evolution of the fire action and the response of materials and structural members comply with Eurocode provisions. The procedure, mainly devoted to identify the most critical fire scenarios for the structural response, is illustrated by means of a case study represented by a steel braced structure, used as parking. Beyond the limitations related to the simplified assumptions, the outcomes of the analyses demonstrate the potential of the approach for choosing fire scenarios by means of a probabilistic procedure and for evaluating the probability of fire-induced progressive collapse. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, land use policy maintaining and enhancing key ecosystems in the UK in most cases does not explicitly take account of this pollution in terms of onsite management prescriptions. In this paper the economic potential of agricultural land retirement to reduce localised nitrogen deposition is examined. Employing a case study that combines nitrogen deposition modelling and agricultural land use change, reductions in nitrogen deposition necessary to reverse the loss of floral diversity are examined. The results indicate that agricultural land retirement is in principle a potentially useful policy instrument for dealing with nitrogen deposition from extensive livestock production. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mite populations in a forest reserve, where accidental fire swept through almost half of the total area covered by the tbrest, were enumerated at one, three, and six months after burning. Mite densities in both burnt and unburnt plots were extremely low immediately after burning. Six months after burn- ing, the density of juvenile cryptostigmatid mites were higher in the burnt area than the unburnt area and several mite genera had recovered from the deleterious effect of burning, but overall mite densities were still lower in the burnt than the unburnt area. Some of the typical dominant mite genera of the tropical rainforest, namely Haplozetes sp., Schetoribates sp.. Nothrus sp. and Carabodes sp. did not recover from the effect of burning within six months. The selective influence of burning on mite gener'dfamilies, as well as the different rates of recovery observed in this study, were attributed to differences in feeding requirements, phenological patterns and file history tactics of the mites. Juvenile cryptostigmatid mites were more in the burnt than unburnt plots suggesting that reproductive activities of this group increased after burning

AB  - Competing uses of land mean that regulations aimed at environmental conservation often conflict with the land-use rights of rural households. Several reports suggest that this has occurred with the introduction of the Natural Forest Protection Programme (NFPP) in China, one of the world's largest logging ban programmes. This paper investigates whether households should be compensated for infringements on property rights, drawing on institutional economics literature on regulation. We distinguish between cases where regulation solves local collective action problems and increases the welfare of those affected, and those where regulation involves a redistribution of rights from one group to another. We apply this to the NFPP by estimating the net welfare impacts, using household level stated preference data with econometric techniques that explicitly account for zero and negative values of the dependent variable. We find that the ban on logging does not affect the net welfare of the affected forest communities. This indicates that the losses resulting from the restrictions on property rights are offset by the benefits from restrictions on other local households. We also find evidence that a partial reduction in logging would be welfare increasing, indicating that the NFPP is to some extent addressing local collective action problems in forest areas. Broader implications for the question of compensating for infringement of property rights as the result of regulatory interventions in contexts of institutional imperfections are also drawn. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In Focus 1, on comparative land use dynamics, models are used to help improve our understanding of the dynamics of land use that arise from human decision-making at all levels, households to nations. These models are supported by surveys and interviews of decision makers. Focus 2 emphasizes development of empirical diagnostic models based on aerial and satellite observations of spatial and temporal land cover dynamics.

AB  - This paper examines the degree of succesws of the city of Curitibia, Brazil, in controlling the energy expended in transport through integrated land use and transport planning. Three key variables - settlement shape, density and location of activities - are applied to the investigation of this rare built example of a linear city. Conclusions are drawn which enable us to compare this city's experience favourably with Western cities, in terms of fuel burn, whilst also raising doubts about the validity of this experience as a benchmark in the context of developing countries.

AB  - Mass fire-spread is a potential threat to some densely built urban areas by its devastating destructions. Especially in case of a large earthquake when multiple fires break out simultaneously, fire-spread hazard is likely to overwhelm fire-fighting capabilities and enlarge damage area. To explore fire-spread behavior and assess its damages, a simulation model of fire-spread in densely built urban areas is developed. Cellular Automata (CA) is a Bottom-up dynamics model that can reproduce a complicated phenomenon by setting up simple rules in a cell space. However, the traditional grid-based cells of CA are not suitable for modeling building-to-building fire-spread behavior. Therefore, an irregular coarse CA schema is proposed in this paper. Two sub-processes are involved urban mass fire-spread, i.e. (I) fire-developing in a single building and (II) fire-spread among buildings. When a fire is developing in a single building, the building will experience 5 fire stages along time, which become the states of cell. While fire spreads among buildings, there are 2 spread patterns: (I) short-range direct flame contact, radiation and convection spread and (II) long-range firebrand spotting spread. In relation to the 2 spread patterns, 2 sets of neighborhoods and rules of CA are formulated respectively. To verify the newly developed model, 100 times of individual random simulations for a real site fire-spread in Kobe City after Hanshin Earthquake (1995, Japan) are performed using an integrated GIS-CA-fire tool developed in the paper. Comparing the simulation results with the local observations, the general feature of fire-spread is found similar, and it is proved that the newly developed model is reliable to simulate urban fire-spread. Furthermore, based on the simulated results, a loss assessment model is formulated to calculate economic and life losses after fire-spread.

AB  - We describe a numerical model to study the propagation of a surface fire in a fuel bed. The objective, in the long term, of these studies is to improve the mode of evaluation of the rate of spread (ROS) of a wildfire in simulations and thereby help to prevent and reduce the risks related to forest fires. The decomposition of solid fuel constituting a forest fuel bed as well as the multiple interactions with the gas phase are represented by adopting a multiphase formulation. This approach consists of solving the conservation equations (mass, momentum, energy, etc.) averaged in a control volume at a scale sufficient to contain several solid particles in the surrounding gas mixture. The calculations, which were carried out in pine needle litter on flat ground and without wind, are compared with experimental data obtained in the laboratory. These results show that the rate of spread of fire in the fuel bed is mainly controlled by radiative heat transfer. When the fuel-bed depth is increased near the extinction limit, the ROS increases quickly, reaches a linear mode, and tends to stay in a saturated mode for which the ROS becomes independent of the height of the litter. By introducing, the optical thickness characterizing the fuel bed, this difference in mode of propagation is interpreted as demonstrated: Two modes of radiative heat transfer corresponding, respectively, to an optically thin and thick medium.

AB  - Generalized integrated structure-control dynamical systems consisting of any number of active/passive controllers and three-dimensional rigid/flexible substructures are investigated. The developed mathematical model assessing the behaviour of these complex systems includes description of general boundary conditions, the interaction mechanisms between structures, power flows and control characteristics. Three active control strategies are examined. That is, multiple channel absolute/relative velocity feedback controllers, their hybrid combination and an existing passive control system to which the former control systems are attached in order to improve overall control efficiency. From the viewpoint of continuum mechanics, an analytical solution of this generalized structure-control system has been developed allowing predictions of the dynamic responses at any point on or in substructures of the coupled system. Absolute or relative dynamic response or receptance, transmissibility, mobility, transfer functions have been derived to evaluate complex dynamic interaction mechanisms through various transmission paths. The instantaneous and time-averaged power flow of energy input, transmission and dissipation or absorption within and between the source substructure, control subsystems and controlled substructure are presented. The general theory developed provides an integrated framework to solve various vibration isolation and control problems and provides a basis to develop a general algorithm that may allow the user to build arbitrarily complex linear control models using simple commands and inputs. The proposed approach is applied to a practical example to illustrate and validate the mathematical model as well as to assess control effectiveness and to provide important guidelines to assist vibration control designers. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land-use change has been identified as one the most important processes to understand and to model global change. It is the result of complex interactions between human and environmental driving factors. A key to capturing this complexity is the analytical framework of land systems as coupled human-environment systems, a concept that is a central component of the science plan of the Global Land Project. Based on this framework, this paper presents an overview of eight integrated models of the land system. The review concentrates on model approaches that include processes of both the human and the environment sub-system and which operate in a spatially explicit manner on a regional to global scale. Another criterion used to select models is that they take into account interplay and competition between different land-use activities, e.g. between agriculture and urban development. Each model is reviewed separately in detail with focus on the different aspects of the land system that are represented within the model and on the implemented modelling concepts. This is done by systematically addressing the following topics: model purpose and application, model concepts for the human sub-system and for the environment sub-system and linkages between the sub-systems (model integration). Based on these findings commonalities and differences between the models are discussed and further research needs are identified.

AB  - Forest fires are growing in size and frequency across the tropics. Continually eroding fragmented forest edges, they are unintended ecological disturbances that transcend deforestation to degrade vast regions of standing forest, diminishing ecosystem services and the economic potential of these natural resources. Affecting the health of millions, net forest fire emissions may have released carbon equivalent to 41% of worldwide fossil fuel use in 1997-98. Episodically more severe during El Ni?o events, pan-tropical forest fires will increase as more damaged, less fire-resistant, forests cover the landscape. Here I discuss the current state of tropical fire science and make recommendations for advancement.

AB  - In 1994, reviews of fire management strategies and practices by State fire authorities and land management agencies in Western Australia, Queensland, Tasmania and New South Wales all revealed disturbing trends in fire management in Australia. All recognised a role for prescribed burning to reduce fuel load and the impact of fire, and to assist fire suppression. Governments, however, are providing fewer resources to land management agencies to undertake fire management and are placing greater demands on volunteers. There is a lack of expertise to ensure management burning meets prescriptions. Despite the repeated conclusions of professional review teams there continue to be claims from people who are opposed to the use of fire for fuel management that prescribed burning is ineffective in reducing the spread and threat of wildfires. Some claims reflect a poor understanding of fire behaviour and may be due to over-simplified assumptions about the relationship between fuels, spread and fire suppression. Recent research has shown that simple direct relationships between fuel load and fire spread cannot be applied to all fuel types. More detailed characterisation of the fuel bed is required to better understand and predict fire behaviour. There is good qualitative evidence that fuel reduction assists fire suppression by reducing the rate of development and the spotting potential of forest fires. Further research is required to quantify the magnitude of these effects under difficult fire weather and the time that they will persist after burning.

AB  - Accidental fire deaths that occurred in Metropolitan Dade County, encompassing Miami, Fla., USA, during the years from 1979 until 1983 were studied. A total of 108 cases were collected, representing 6.1% of the nontraffic-related accidents during this 5-year period, and analyzed as to the age, race, sex, cause of death of the victim along with the blood alcohol content at autopsy, toxicologic analysis, location of the fire, and how the fire started. Essentially, the victims ages cluster in the 0-5 years and does 70 years, although other age groups are evenly distributed. A white male population predominates. The cause of death is listed as either smoke inhalation or thermal injury. Most toxicologic analyses were not performed due to the high rate of fire rescue intervention and at least emergency room hospitalization prior to death. Carboxyhemoglobin levels, when analyzed, ranged from less than 20% to over 80%. In a smaller group of cases, cyanide was analyzed for and was found negative (or none detected) in the majority of the cases. More fires occurred in residences and started due to cigarette smoking or electric malfunction.

As a result, the relationshipsbetweenbiodiversity in its broadest senseandland use can becomplexandhighly context dependent.

The review will also consider whether framing biodiversity objectives involves society in placing constraints upon the types of land use andmanagementpractice that are possible,andwill considersuchargumentsin relation to assessments of the costs of biodiversity loss. It would seem that while considerable progress has been made in mapping out plausible futures for land use and biodiversity at global and regional scales, closer integration of modelling, scenario and field-based monitoring is needed to strengthen the evidence base available to decision makers.

AB  - Nearly 100 years after its discovery poliovirus remains one of most thoroughly studied and best understood virus models for the molecular virologist. While poliovirus has been of vital importance for our insight into picornavirus biology at the cellular and biochemical level, it is ironic to note that, due to the early success in defeating poliomyelitis in the developed world through vaccination, many of the basic aspects of poliovirus pathogenesis remain poorly understood. This is chiefly due to the lack of an adequate and affordable animal model, save of old world monkeys. Fundamental questions, such as the identity of the target cells during the enteric phase of infection, or mechanisms of systemic spread are still unanswered. This review will attempt to summarize our current knowledge of the molecular biology of poliovirus, its pathogenesis, as well as recent advances in the areas of cell and tissue tropism and mechanisms of central nervous system invasion. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A land use and transportation interaction model was developed for the Sacramento, California, region, using the MEPLAN framework. The model represents land markets directly together with location-choice processes of different industry and household categories and the interactions among them. These resulting economic interactions lead to trip matrixes that are assigned to a multimodal, capacity-restrained transportation network, generating travel times and disutilities that influence the location-choice process in the period from 1990 to 2015. A range of different policy options is simulated for that period. Five different scenarios are compared with a trend scenario, three representing different long- and short-term government transportation supply scenarios, one representing incentives and disincentives to encourage land use patterns complementary to an improved transit system, and one combining the land-incentive scenario with higher prices for private vehicle use. The scenario predictions differ in mode choice, firm location, residential location, development patterns, vehicle kilometers traveled, and land rents. Various land uses are seen to be bidding against each other, and the differences in spatial arrangements between scenarios are quite complex and demonstrate the richness of the model. Certain changes take time to develop, demonstrating the need for a long-term approach to planning.

AB  - The Event Calculus (Kowalski and Sergo, 1986; Miller and Shanahan, 1991), a descendant of Situation Calculus (McCarthy and Hayes, 1969), is perhaps the best-fleshed-out attempt to apply predicate logic to the task of reasoning about commonsense events. A recent book by Erik Mueller (2006) reviews the application of Event Calculus to the solution of a variety of “commonsense inference problems,” defined as simplified abstractions of real-world situations. This brief, informal article describes a variation of Event Calculus called Probabilistic Event Calclus, in which the strict implications from standard Event Calculus are replaced with probabilistic implications, and other changes are also introduced, such as a repositioning of events and actions in the basic event ontology, and the introduction of a simpler mechanism to avoid the use of circumscription for avoiding the “frame problem.” These changes make it much easier to use Event Calculus type reasoning within the Probabilistic Logic Networks (PLN) inference framework (Ikle’ et al, 2006) created for use within the integrative Novamente AI Engine artificial general intelligence architecture (Goertzel, 2006). More qualitatively, it is suggested that these changes also result in a more “cognitively natural” sort of Event Calculus; though of course this sort of claim is hard to substantiate rigorously, and we will not pursue this line of argument here, except to a few simple points: • There is growing evidence for probabilistic calculations in the human brain, whereas neural bases for crisp predicate logic and higher-order logic mechanisms like circumscription have never been identified even preliminarily • The use of probabilistic implications makes clearer how reasoning about events may interoperate with perceptions of events (given that perception is generally uncertain) and data mining of regularities from streams of perceptions of events (which also will generally produce regularities with uncertain truth values) • As will be discussed in the final section, the pragmatic resolution of the “frame problem” seems more straightforward using a probabilistic variant of Event Calculus, in which different events can have different levels of persistence

For\nthis, two one-dimensional radiative models for fire spread in a porous\nforest fuel bed are derived from albini's model (1986), The sensitivity\nof these two models to uncertain input parameters, particularly the\nemissive powers of the ignition interface and of the flame, are shown.\nThe predictions of spread rates from the two models are then compared\nagainst the observed values for different fuel loads and slopes for two\nkinds of pine litter. In most cases, the observed effects are poorly\npredicted when fixed emissive powers are used. Thus, in a second step,\nthe necessary values of emissive powers to be used for predicting the\nobserved effects are researched. Although reasonable values of emissive\npowers are apparently required in most cases, it is suggested that the\nheat loss due to free convection in the energy balance should be\nreplaced by convective heat transfer depending on the gas temperature\nprofile, in order to give better estimates of the observed effects.

AB  - China has launched a series of land policy reforms to improve land-use efficiency, to rationalize land allocation, to enhance land management, and to coordinate urban and rural development. These land policy reforms have yielded positive impacts on urban land use as well as negative socioeconomic consequences. On the positive side, they have contributed to emerging land markets, increased government revenue for the financing of massive infrastructure projects and provision of public goods, and improved the rationalization of land use. On the negative side, problems such as loss of social equity, socioeconomic conflicts, and government corruption have emerged. This paper reviews China's land policy reform in a historical context and then examines the impacts on urban development and land use. Policy implications are discussed at the end.

AB  - A primary driver in land titling and administration improvement is facilitation of a land market. Land markets are difficult to establish and to manage. Titling on its own will not create a land market, nor will a land administration system unless it is connected with the way participants think about and organise their land. Indeed, the difficulty is compounded because very little is available to explain how a land market works, particularly to identify non-technical components essential for market success. This framework article explains land markets in terms of five evolutionary stages. The ingredients of a complex and developed land market, especially social processes and cognitive capacities, are identified. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Metropolitan areas have come under intense pressure to respond to federal mandates to link planning of land use, transportation, and environmental quality; and from citizen concerns about managing the side effects of growth such as sprawl, congestion, housing affordability, and loss of open space. The planning models used by metropolitan planning organizations were generally not designed to address these issues, creating a gap in the abil- ity of planners to systematically assess them. UrbanSim is a new model sys- tem that was developed to respond to these emerging requirements and has now been applied in three metropoli- tan areas. This article describes the model system and its application to Eugene-Springfield, Oregon.

AB  - In this note a study of hadronic event shapes in QCD events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is presented. Calorimetric jet momenta, determined by various jet clustering algorithms, are used as input for calculating various event-shape variables which probe the structure of the hadronic final state. It is shown that the normalized event-shape distributions are robust under variations of the jet energy scale and resolution effects, which makes them particularly suitable for early data analysis and tuning of Monte Carlo models.

AB  - The article presents information on issues related to fire risk assessment. Terry O'Neill, managing director, Trenton Fire Ltd., says that under the workplace regulations, employers have a legal obligation to undertake regular fire risk assessments of the workplace if one or more persons are employed. The new fire safety order will replace the existing Fire Precautions Act of 1971 and the more recent fire precautions workplace regulations of 1997, and is expected to be introduced in 2005. Good fire safety practices can reduce the occurrences and effects of fire on both life safety and property protection.

AB  - Currently there are no internationally accepted methodologies to evaluate and compare the performance of land administration systems. This is partly because land administration systems are in constant reform, and probably more importantly, they represent societies’ different perceptions of land. This paper describes the development of a framework to measure and compare the performance of land administration systems. The research is of particular relevance since it develops a management model which links the operational aspects of land administration with land policy.

AB  - We investigate how fire regime may influence both temporal patterns and drivers of vegetation regeneration in a Natural Park (NW Spain) affected by a long history of fire events and human activities. To address this issue, we evaluate the suitability of five spectral indices derived from Landsat imagery (for the period 1992–2005) for estimating biophysical properties of vegetation and monitoring post-fire recovery. Complementarily, we assess the role of the observation level (pixel and patch) on the results, identifying which of them is more informative for land management. Tasselled Cap Wetness was the best-performing index and total cover was the vegetation property more closely related to spectral data. Most post-fire recovery occurred within the 2 years following the fire event. Fire recurrence did not influence patch extent or shape nor did it affect ecosystem resilience. However, patch extent and shape affected resilience. The relevance of the environmental drivers behind vegetation recovery was not related to fire recurrence and changed over time. Prior vegetation status and rainfall were the most important drivers, while topography and vegetation type had a more secondary role. Our results advocate the consideration of patches as the most appropriate organisational unit when monitoring vegetation recovery.

The procedure was used to document an experimental prescribed fire that exhibited a large variability in rate of spread. Heat content is relatively constant, and of the two remaining inputs, rate of spread is by far the most variable and difficult to measure in the field. In the present paper, a procedure is described that indicates the direction and rate of spread more accurately than current methods.

AB  - How Injections Work: I am now almost exclusively using injection into oocytes of young adults to assay transient expression and make transformed lines. In order to do this easily it is crucial that the worms be in a fairly narrow window of desiccation on the agarose pads: immobile and dry enough to be easily injected but damp enough so that the oocyte nuclei can be seen under nomarski 400x. I think that under optimal conditions the insides worm actually turn into a gel, which allows very facile and directed injection. Enhanced gelation at low temperature is presumably why injection is so much easier in a cool room. Since my lab hovers around 22 C, I have modified the procedure somewhat in that I grow the animals to be injected on the wettest plates that can be found, and use a fairly wet plate (~1-2 days old) as an intermediate between the growth plate and the injection pad. When possible I cool the animals down above an ice bucket (~8 C) for 15-30 min before injection. In order to keep them from drying out on the pad it is advantageous to find proper spacing between animals. The animals are becoming dehydrated as their water diffuses into the agarose pad underneath. If the animals are placed close together, then the zones of water diffusing out from different worms will overlap, which will slow down the desiccation. If they are placed too close together then not enough desiccation occurs and they are difficult to inject. Play with pad thickness, intermediate plate wetness, time between mounting and injection, and animal spacing. Since recovery after injection is presumably the reversal of the gelled state, one might expect this to proceed much more readily at higher temperature. This is indeed true; animals seem to recover much more efficiently at 25 C, and this is now the standard (usually 2-7hrs of recovery). On DNA Quality: Our DNAs are no longer prepared by running CsCl gradients. Instead, we have been using a cleaned up plasmid miniprep procedure. The DNA obtained from CsCl gradients of large scale preps is actually less clean than after the cleaned up minipreps. Briefly, plasmids in E. Coli DH5alpha are grown up overnight in 17mm culture tubes with 3ml 2xYT medium. 1.5 ml of this is subject to the standard alkaline/SDS miniprep procedure and cleared by a LiCl precipitation step. This material is then treated with RNAse, then Protease K, extracted with Phenol/ChCl3 then CHCl3, precipitated twice with ethanol and resuspended in standard TE (detailed protocol on request). DNA prepared just through the lithium stage is injectable, but there is still a considerable amount of protein and RNA at this stage, and variability in cleanliness between different crude minipreps tends to cast some doubt on negative results. In general all of our important negative results are repeated with two different minipreps or if possible with two different plasmid isolates. Our current DNA concentrations are 60-150 g/ml. There still doesn't seem to be any obvious dependence of copy number or transformation frequency on DNA concentration. If a plasmid seems to be having trouble giving heritable transformants, I usually drop the DNA concentration 2 fold. Types of Transformation: First some words. A transformation event is an effect mediated by injected DNA. In transient transformation the animal which is transformed does not pass the trait on to its progeny. In heritable transformation the transforming trait is passed on to the progeny of the original transformed animal. In non- chromosomal transformation the transforming DNA is present as a separate molecule and not associated with a C. elegans chromosome or a large piece thereof. Chromosomal transformation consists of joining of injected DNA sequences with C. elegans chromosomes. A subset of this, integrative transformation, consists of the integration of transforming DNA into or onto fully functional C. elegans chromosomes. Homozygote transformants are transformed lines that grow as uniformly transformed stocks. The term 'stable transformant' seems to mean something different to everybody and it is hereby retired. Given these words the take home lesson to date is that almost anything can happen. In selection schemes, such as most sup-7 vectors, that yield low copy number transformants, the injected DNAs in transformed lines are either present as integrated copies, which should behave in some sort of mendelian fashion, or as a few copies attached to a piece of a normal C. elegans chromosome which has broken off (an injection induced 'free dup'). These free dups are visible with DAPI stain and usually contain much more DNA than can be accounted for by the number of copies of the transforming DNA (D. Albertson p.c. and our unpublished observations). Generally about half of the low copy number transformants are these hybrid dups. Their genetic behavior can be bizarre with highly variable transmission ratios and occasional odd phenotypes, but this rarely effects the ability of genes on the transforming molecules to function properly. Transformation selections that can be satisfied by high copy number non-chromosomal arrays of the injected DNA will generally yield these long arrays as the primary product. This is particularly true with cytoplasmic as opposed to nuclear injection (nuclear injection is apparently required for chromosomal transformation; maybe the chromosomes have to be broken by the needle). In several cases the high copy number tandem arrays have actually integrated into a chromosome. At one point it was believed that the large extrachromosomal tandem arrays were not properly expressed in terms of tissue specificity. This does not appear to be the case with unc-54. Long tandem arrays of the unc-54 gene express the protein at high levels. The over- expressed protein accumulates without assembling properly, but is limited only to body wall type muscles. It is worth keeping in mind, even if genes present on the tandem arrays can be properly regulated, that the presence of 1000 fold excess of a specific gene or product within a given cell is relatively likely to have bizarre effects due to antisense, over-expression, etc. Integrative Transformation with Linear DNAs has been tested using the unc-54 gene (the formation of large non-chromosomal tandem arrays from linear DNA has been demonstrated by Shaw et al. and A. F. and D. Moerman). Integrative transformants were obtained with linear unc-54 DNA [PvuII cut punk54] at a frequency comparable to that for circular DNA; in general the ends of the DNA seem to be slightly modified, since the end restriction enzyme site is lost. The linear DNAs function surprisingly poorly in transient expression, giving only a fraction of the signal observed with the corresponding circle. This could be due to instability or inactivity of the free linear molecule, or alternatively to efficient concatenation of the injected molecules. Linearized sup-7 plasmids are as active a circles for transient expression in the distal tip region of the gonad, but much less active for transient expression when injected into oocytes. Homologous Recombination Between Injected Molecules was tested by injecting two plasmids containing deletions in different parts of the unc-54 gene. Each of these plasmids by itself is inactive. A single transformed line (an integrant) has been derived from co-injection of the two plasmids. A band corresponding to the recombined fragment can be observed on southern blots of the strain (with several enzymes) as well as the two parental bands. Thus there is at least some level of recombination between injected molecules. We are now testing for the presence of the reciprocal fragment and other nonselected recombination fragments to assess recombination frequency. There was no transient expression after co-injection of the two deletions. This suggests that the burst of F1 transient expression after injection of oocytes with unc-54 constructs might very well be due to partitioning and expression of the injected circular DNAs rather than formation of large tandem arrays outside the germline. Tetraploid transformants and 'transformants': Judith Kimble originally discovered that microinjection can induce triploids and tetraploids. For some selections this is a concern since polyploid animals can appear rescued, and are generally observed frequently enough to be a problem. For selections that polyploidy does not interfere with, it turns out that a fraction of the real transformants are tetraploid, or more often triploids that eventually yield tetraploid stocks. The polyploids are very long and exhibit some odd segregation, but in general can be treated and analyzed as are other transformed lines. Gene Fusion Vectors and Requirements for Expression: If you're designing fusion constructs to use a reporter gene for monitoring gene expression keep in mind that the insides of gene are far from inert. There was a really good nematode splice signal in B-gal. I'm not sure how this affects expression but the site is taken out in our active unc-54: gal fusions. Likewise please note in the accompanying article on unc-54 expression that worm genes may need more than what is on their 5' end to make product efficiently. Different sup-7 vectors have different properties: A number of sup-7 vectors constructed by R. Waterston and myself have been used as selectable markers for transformation. In general these have been cloned in such a way that sequences upstream the sup-7 gene (-20 and beyond) derive from the particular site used in the cloning vector. These plasmids all give chromosomal transformants, but the average copy number tends to vary between constructs. The pAST plasmid generally gave 2-8 copies while constructs in pAST 19b usually give only one or two copies. For some experiments low copy number is advantageous, but it is worth keeping in mind that a circular molecule has to break somewhere and hence disrupt some region in order to integrate as

We are now testing for the presence of the reciprocal fragment and other nonselected recombination fragments to assess recombination frequency. There was no transient expression after co-injection of the two deletions. This suggests that the burst of F1 transient expression after injection of oocytes with unc-54 constructs might very well be due to partitioning and expression of the injected circular DNAs rather than formation of large tandem arrays outside the germline. Tetraploid transformants and 'transformants': Judith Kimble originally discovered that microinjection can induce triploids and tetraploids. For some selections this is a concern since polyploid animals can appear rescued, and are generally observed frequently enough to be a problem. For selections that polyploidy does not interfere with, it turns out that a fraction of the real transformants are tetraploid, or more often triploids that eventually yield tetraploid stocks. The polyploids are very long and exhibit some odd segregation, but in general can be treated and analyzed as are other transformed lines. Gene Fusion Vectors and Requirements for Expression: If you're designing fusion constructs to use a reporter gene for monitoring gene expression keep in mind that the insides of gene are far from inert. There was a really good nematode splice signal in B-gal. I'm not sure how this affects expression but the site is taken out in our active unc-54: gal fusions. Likewise please note in the accompanying article on unc-54 expression that worm genes may need more than what is on their 5' end to make product efficiently. Different sup-7 vectors have different properties: A number of sup-7 vectors constructed by R. Waterston and myself have been used as selectable markers for transformation. In general these have been cloned in such a way that sequences upstream the sup-7 gene (-20 and beyond) derive from the particular site used in the cloning vector. These plasmids all give chromosomal transformants, but the average copy number tends to vary between constructs. The pAST plasmid generally gave 2-8 copies while constructs in pAST 19b usually give only one or two copies. For some experiments low copy number is advantageous, but it is worth keeping in mind that a circular molecule has to break somewhere and hence disrupt some region in order to integrate as

AB  - How Injections Work: I am now almost exclusively using injection into oocytes of young adults to assay transient expression and make transformed lines. In order to do this easily it is crucial that the worms be in a fairly narrow window of desiccation on the agarose pads: immobile and dry enough to be easily injected but damp enough so that the oocyte nuclei can be seen under nomarski 400x. I think that under optimal conditions the insides worm actually turn into a gel, which allows very facile and directed injection. Enhanced gelation at low temperature is presumably why injection is so much easier in a cool room. Since my lab hovers around 22 C, I have modified the procedure somewhat in that I grow the animals to be injected on the wettest plates that can be found, and use a fairly wet plate (~1-2 days old) as an intermediate between the growth plate and the injection pad. When possible I cool the animals down above an ice bucket (~8 C) for 15-30 min before injection. In order to keep them from drying out on the pad it is advantageous to find proper spacing between animals. The animals are becoming dehydrated as their water diffuses into the agarose pad underneath. If the animals are placed close together, then the zones of water diffusing out from different worms will overlap, which will slow down the desiccation. If they are placed too close together then not enough desiccation occurs and they are difficult to inject. Play with pad thickness, intermediate plate wetness, time between mounting and injection, and animal spacing. Since recovery after injection is presumably the reversal of the gelled state, one might expect this to proceed much more readily at higher temperature. This is indeed true; animals seem to recover much more efficiently at 25 C, and this is now the standard (usually 2-7hrs of recovery). On DNA Quality: Our DNAs are no longer prepared by running CsCl gradients. Instead, we have been using a cleaned up plasmid miniprep procedure. The DNA obtained from CsCl gradients of large scale preps is actually less clean than after the cleaned up minipreps. Briefly, plasmids in E. Coli DH5alpha are grown up overnight in 17mm culture tubes with 3ml 2xYT medium. 1.5 ml of this is subject to the standard alkaline/SDS miniprep procedure and cleared by a LiCl precipitation step. This material is then treated with RNAse, then Protease K, extracted with Phenol/ChCl3 then CHCl3, precipitated twice with ethanol and resuspended in standard TE (detailed protocol on request). DNA prepared just through the lithium stage is injectable, but there is still a considerable amount of protein and RNA at this stage, and variability in cleanliness between different crude minipreps tends to cast some doubt on negative results. In general all of our important negative results are repeated with two different minipreps or if possible with two different plasmid isolates. Our current DNA concentrations are 60-150 g/ml. There still doesn't seem to be any obvious dependence of copy number or transformation frequency on DNA concentration. If a plasmid seems to be having trouble giving heritable transformants, I usually drop the DNA concentration 2 fold. Types of Transformation: First some words. A transformation event is an effect mediated by injected DNA. In transient transformation the animal which is transformed does not pass the trait on to its progeny. In heritable transformation the transforming trait is passed on to the progeny of the original transformed animal. In non- chromosomal transformation the transforming DNA is present as a separate molecule and not associated with a C. elegans chromosome or a large piece thereof. Chromosomal transformation consists of joining of injected DNA sequences with C. elegans chromosomes. A subset of this, integrative transformation, consists of the integration of transforming DNA into or onto fully functional C. elegans chromosomes. Homozygote transformants are transformed lines that grow as uniformly transformed stocks. The term 'stable transformant' seems to mean something different to everybody and it is hereby retired. Given these words the take home lesson to date is that almost anything can happen. In selection schemes, such as most sup-7 vectors, that yield low copy number transformants, the injected DNAs in transformed lines are either present as integrated copies, which should behave in some sort of mendelian fashion, or as a few copies attached to a piece of a normal C. elegans chromosome which has broken off (an injection induced 'free dup'). These free dups are visible with DAPI stain and usually contain much more DNA than can be accounted for by the number of copies of the transforming DNA (D. Albertson p.c. and our unpublished observations). Generally about half of the low copy number transformants are these hybrid dups. Their genetic behavior can be bizarre with highly variable transmission ratios and occasional odd phenotypes, but this rarely effects the ability of genes on the transforming molecules to function properly. Transformation selections that can be satisfied by high copy number non-chromosomal arrays of the injected DNA will generally yield these long arrays as the primary product. This is particularly true with cytoplasmic as opposed to nuclear injection (nuclear injection is apparently required for chromosomal transformation; maybe the chromosomes have to be broken by the needle). In several cases the high copy number tandem arrays have actually integrated into a chromosome. At one point it was believed that the large extrachromosomal tandem arrays were not properly expressed in terms of tissue specificity. This does not appear to be the case with unc-54. Long tandem arrays of the unc-54 gene express the protein at high levels. The over- expressed protein accumulates without assembling properly, but is limited only to body wall type muscles. It is worth keeping in mind, even if genes present on the tandem arrays can be properly regulated, that the presence of 1000 fold excess of a specific gene or product within a given cell is relatively likely to have bizarre effects due to antisense, over-expression, etc. Integrative Transformation with Linear DNAs has been tested using the unc-54 gene (the formation of large non-chromosomal tandem arrays from linear DNA has been demonstrated by Shaw et al. and A. F. and D. Moerman). Integrative transformants were obtained with linear unc-54 DNA [PvuII cut punk54] at a frequency comparable to that for circular DNA; in general the ends of the DNA seem to be slightly modified, since the end restriction enzyme site is lost. The linear DNAs function surprisingly poorly in transient expression, giving only a fraction of the signal observed with the corresponding circle. This could be due to instability or inactivity of the free linear molecule, or alternatively to efficient concatenation of the injected molecules. Linearized sup-7 plasmids are as active a circles for transient expression in the distal tip region of the gonad, but much less active for transient expression when injected into oocytes. Homologous Recombination Between Injected Molecules was tested by injecting two plasmids containing deletions in different parts of the unc-54 gene. Each of these plasmids by itself is inactive. A single transformed line (an integrant) has been derived from co-injection of the two plasmids. A band corresponding to the recombined fragment can be observed on southern blots of the strain (with several enzymes) as well as the two parental bands. Thus there is at least some level of recombination between injected molecules. We are now testing for the presence of the reciprocal fragment and other nonselected recombination fragments to assess recombination frequency. There was no transient expression after co-injection of the two deletions. This suggests that the burst of F1 transient expression after injection of oocytes with unc-54 constructs might very well be due to partitioning and expression of the injected circular DNAs rather than formation of large tandem arrays outside the germline.

AB  - Emergency service systems such as community fire departments respond to and resolve unplanned events within a given service area. A review of the literature addressing such systems indicates that existing research is almost exclusively focused on higher level planning issues such as facility location and resource allocation. In contrast, this study addresses the operational level of such a system, an existing fire department's response to residential structure fire. Such a response exhibits many of the elements of traditional project management, such as distinctly defined tasks and significant predecessor relationships. However, the defining characteristic of these projects is not simply expediency, but the fact that the structure of the project can change if the preceding project structure does not complete some aspect of its task sequence within an interval of time dictated by some external pacing function. What emerges is a unique and intriguing class of project, dubbed the hyper-project in this study. The concept of the hyper-project is discussed both in its general form and with respect to the aforementioned case study example. Readily transferable to non-emergency applications, the hyper-project typifies and unites a heretofore unrecognized family of operations, highlighting the opportunities for future research. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Landslide risk reduction in developing countries is preferable to disaster remediation and recovery, in both social and economic terms. The implementation of landslide preventative measures is closely related to the development of 'good practice' in land use management, at government and community levels, especially in the face of rapid and unplanned urbanisation. These areas of poverty and vulnerability to 'natural' hazards present a challenging environment for which to develop realistic land use policies and practices. There is little evidence of on-the-ground delivery of landslide risk reduction. However, scientifically based landslide risk reduction strategies can be effective. In the Eastern Caribbean construction of drainage networks in communities afforded an improvement in slope stability - after a 1 in 100-year rainfall event there were no landslides on previously unstable slopes in densely populated urban communities. This has been recognised in policy terms in the first ever Caribbean-wide, 5-year risk reduction programme. Such evidence represents an important first step in developing realistic land use policies for landslide-prone areas occupied by those migrating to urban centres in the Eastern Caribbean. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A sample of this data collected over a five-year period has been used to characterise the distributions of fire sizes, fire growth rates and times between events that occur in building fires in a form suitable for use with probabilistic risk assessment. The effect of occupancy type, ignition source, first material ignited, and first aid fire-fighting by the occupants on the form of these distributions was then examined. Incidents that produced very large losses, rapid growth rates and extended time delays were also analysed to try to determine the reasons why such extremes occur in real fires. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land-use change is both a cause and consequence of many biophysical and socioeconomic changes. The CLUMondo model provides an innovative approach for global land-use change modeling to support integrated assessments. Demands for goods and services are, in the model, supplied by a variety of land systems that are characterized by their land cover mosaic, the agricultural management intensity, and livestock. Land system changes are simulated by the model, driven by regional demand for goods and influenced by local factors that either constrain or promote land system conversion. A characteristic of the new model is the endogenous simulation of intensification of agricultural management versus expansion of arable land, and urban versus rural settlements expansion based on land availability in the neighborhood of the location. Model results for the OECD Environmental Outlook scenario show that allocation of increased agricultural production by either management intensification or area expansion varies both among and within world regions, providing useful insight into the land sparing versus land sharing debate. The land system approach allows the inclusion of different types of demand for goods and services from the land system as a driving factor of land system change. Simulation results are compared to observed changes over the 1970-2000 period and projections of other global and regional land change models.

AB  - Land consumption due to residential development, economic growth and transportation belongs to the most serious environmental pressures on landscapes worldwide, in particular in urbanised areas. Accordingly, the aim of containing the development of land is rated increasingly high on the agenda of environmental policy, at least in densely populated countries such as Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands or the UK. As a result, different strategies and instruments to prevent excessive land consumption are being discussed. However, many of these strategies and instruments adopt a rather general approach, while it seems more effective to define the particular areas where the goal of reducing land consumption is to be pursued. Such an approach must draw on information about how detrimental specific land use transitions are with regard to, for instance, the functionality of soils, water balance or habitat quality at specific locations. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for the impact assessment of land use transition in urban areas which highlights how such information can be acquired. This framework includes the differentiation of two levels of impact assessment: the level of the single land unit and the context level which takes into account regional and aggregated impacts of land use transition bound to the spatial context. The conceptual framework provides a basis to disaggregate (supra-)national policy targets regarding land use, to scale them down to the regional level, and thus to clarify the spatially explicit implications of land use policies.

AB  - The impact of fire use and hazard in frontier settlement is a critical envi- ronmental concern that has been historically overshadowed by deforestation issues- and thus underexamined at local and regional scales by social scien- tists. Consequently, conceptual frameworks of LUCC change consider fire use as an outcome of land use decisions and neglect the capacity of burning choices to influence these decisions and subsequent land cover change. This paper examines the relationship of settlement, land use, and fire use. It con- siders recentLUCCframeworks, and then uses household surveys on fire use practices to discuss how the study of fire use can contribute to understanding frontier landscape change. Planting decisions, settlement history, location de- sires, and burning logistics work in combination to influence burning choices and thus LUCC.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that manipulation of landscape patterns is the most preferred method to reduce susceptibility of landscape to fire spread. We evaluated the effects of landscape spatial pattern and spatial heterogeneity of fuel loading on surface fire spread using the FARSITE model in Chequamegon National Forest landscape, Wisconsin. Five forest management scenarios were developed to generate different landscape spatial patterns with unique fuel loading distribution. For each management scenario, 16 fires were simulated. We found that altered landscape spatial pattern and spatial heterogeneity of fuel loading interactively influenced fire spread. Moreover, we revealed that numerous, irregular-shaped, and different types of patches reduced fire spread. Among tested indices of landscape spatial pattern, patchy density, mean patch shape, patch shape standard deviation, area weighted mean shape index (AWMSI) and Shannon's diversity index were meaningful for predicting fire spread. However, the effect of landscape spatial pattern on fire spread decreased as fuel loading became more spatially heterogeneous. We also found that the effect of landscape spatial pattern on fire spread became insignificant when AWMSI was less than 4.33. Our results suggested that a forest management plan would need to consider the number, shape, size and type of forest patches for regulating fire spread. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent advances in passenger rail transportation, fire test methods, and hazard analysis necessitate re-examination of requirements for fire safety. Several studies have indicated nearly random ability of current bench-scale tests to predict actual fire behavior. Fire safety in any application, including transportation, requires a multi-faceted approach. The effects of vehicle design, material selection, detection and suppression systems, and emergency egress and their interaction, on the overall fire safety of the passenger trains must all be considered. The strengths and weaknesses of current methods for measuring the fire performance of rail transportation systems are evaluated. A systems approach to fire safety which addressed typical passenger train fire scenarios is analyzed. A rationale is presented for the direction in which most fire science-oriented organizations in the world are clearly headed - the use of fire hazard and fire risk assessment methods supported by measurement methods based on heat release rate.

AB  - The Amazon is being rapidly transformed by fire. Logging and forest fragmentation sharply elevate fire incidence by increasing forest desiccation and fuel loads, and forests that have experienced a low-intensity surface fire are vulnerable to far more catastrophic fires. Satellites typically detect thermal signatures from 40 000 to 50 000 separate fires in the Amazon each year, and this number could increase as new highways and infrastructure expand across the basin. Many are concerned that large-scale deforestation, by reducing regional evapotranspiration and creating moisture-trapping smoke plumes, will make the basin increasingly vulnerable to fire. The Amazon may also be affected by future global warming and atmospheric changes, although much remains uncertain. Most models suggest the basin will become warmer throughout this century, although there is no consensus about how precipitation will be affected. The most alarming scenarios project a permanent disruption of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, leading to greatly increased drought or destructive synergisms between regional and global climate change in the Amazon.

Fires are central in the ecology of tropical ecosystems and can act as a threat or a regenerating factor depending on the ecosystem adaptations to it. Many ecosystems in the world are fire-dependent and for them fire is essential to maintain their functionalities and their biodiversity. The importance of fire in global conservation has been recognized in the Preliminary Assessment of Fire as a Global Conservation Issue by Hardesty et al. [1]. Their analysis shows that “around 84% of the ecoregions identified by scientists as critical for global conservation have altered fire regimes. This alteration can cause biodiversity loss and habitat degradation”. Besides its relevance for conservation, fire is also a common practice for land management in the tropical regions.

AB  - One of the key requirements of the European Union (EU) for accession of Central European countries (CEC) to the EU is the establishment of free market economies which parallel the economies in Western Europe based on the adoption of the Acquis Communautaire (Acquis) from the EU. Central to this objective is the privatisation of lands and the establishment of efficient land markets. To this end the EU and many other countries and international organisations have committed significant resources to support land administration, and particularly cadastral projects, in Central Europe since 1992. This paper reviews the role that the establishment of land administration systems is playing in the accession of CEC to the EU. Other key requirements for accession to the EU are the adoption of the Common Agricultural Policy, the protection of human rights, environmental sustainability and institution building. The paper also considers the role that land administration plays in supporting these objectives and develops a generic framework for land administration projects in support of accession to the EU. As background the paper uses examples to highlight the historical context of land, the evolution of land administration in Central Europe, the reconstruction of property rights and the justification of land administration projects in the context of AGENDA 2000 for a wider Europe. The paper provides an international context by examining land administration trends globally. The paper concludes by highlighting the challenges facing the establishment of land administration systems in CEC.

AB  - Many nations lack a coherent national approach to land administration.\nInstead, land information and processes are frequently disaggregated\nacross states, provinces, cantons, counties, or municipalities. This\nis particularly the case in federated countries. The growing body\nof land administration theory often assumes or prescribes the need\nfor national systems; however, the justification for this approach\nrequires further explanation. Without justification, nations that\nmaintain disaggregated systems lack the impetus to unlock the opportunities\nveiled within their disparate land administration systems. Moreover,\na nation's ability to respond effectively to emerging national and\nglobal-scale issues such as climate-change is greatly impeded. This\npaper aims to explain the need for national land administration infrastructures.\nQualitative case studies of the Australian context and the method\nof triangulation inform the justification. The research reveals most\ndrivers can be classified into six overarching subsets: adherence\nto international standards by national governments, better federal\nor central governance, improved shared governance, scale of economies\nfor lower levels of government, opportunities and savings for business,\nand social inclusion for citizens. Unfortunately, specific drivers\nare found to be complex and changeable, as political, scientific\nand environmental debates raise policy issues: there is no single\nsolution. As an alternative, nations must seize on the specific drivers\nrelevant to their context. They must employ them to transform disparate\nland administration systems into multi-purpose national land administration\ninfrastructures that deliver benefits to all stakeholder groups.\n© 2011.

AB  - Mathematical modeling of fire behavior prediction is only possible if the models are supplied with an information database that provides spatially explicit input parameters for modeled area. Mathematical models can be of three kinds: 1) physical; 2) empirical; and 3) quasi-empirical (Sullivan, 2009). Physical models (Grishin, 1992) are of academic interest only because current vegetation monitoring techniques make it virtually impossible to parameterize the model precluding its general application in wildland fire management (Sullivan, 2009). Empirical models (Vonsky, 1957; Amosov, 1964; Korovin, 1969) can give satisfactory results but only for the fires on areas from which experimental data were obtained and generalized. Quasi-empirical models include empirically derived physical and chemical properties of the fuels thereby extending their potential application to many vegetation types. Among quasi-empirical models, Rothermels (1972) model is the basis for the US National Fire Danger Rating System (Deeming et al., 1978), the BEHAVE-Plus (Andrews et al., 2005) and FARSITE (Finney 1998) models (FBP). Development of the US FBP System became possible owing to creation of an information database through division of vegetation into fuel models (Anderson, 1982; Scott, Burgan, 2005). However, the characteristics are rather rough because the number of fuel models is limited and the diversity of the vegetation cover is large in terms of fire science. Russian quasi-empirical models (Telitsin, 1973; Konev, 1984; Gusev, 2005; Dorrer, 2008) do not provide the vegetation fuel (VF) data base necessary to apply their models. The creation of the VF information database was developed theoretically and practically only for the model developed at the Sukachev Institute of Forest (Sofronov, 1967; Volokitina, Sofronov, 2002). The mathematical model used for surface fire growth prediction is very simple: Vx = Vо Kw Kr Kϕ, where Vо no-wind-no-slope spread rate, m/minute; Кw variable wind coefficient; Kr variable relative humidity coefficient; Kϕ - variable slope coefficient. No-wind-no-slope spread rate shows the capacity of fire to spread over the given fuel under standard combination of dynamic external factors (wind 0 m/s, slope - 0, and relative humidity 40%). On the basis of experimental data and observations on fires, the no-wind-no-slope spread rate was determined for each type of a primary fire carrier depending upon the fire weather index (Sofronov, Volokitina, 1990). Relative influence of wind, slope, and humidity on fire spread rate was established during experimental prescribed burns and fire experiments (Sofronov, 1967). A computer program has been developed for surface fire growth prediction.

AB  - This working paper serves as an introductory reference for those studying the application of land- use–transportation models to the simulation of urban systems. The paper is by no means comprehensive, but aims to provide the reader with a foundation in the basic principles underlying land-use–transportation models and to set those principles in the context of urban management and urban studies. The paper opens with taxonomy of urban simulation models and a treatment of descriptive and analytical models. This serves to situate land-use–transportation models in the context of a broader simulation environment. The paper then reviews land-use–transportation models according to their simulation techniques and individual components. Towards the second half of the paper, the discussion moves to a critical overview of urban simulation and deals with model weaknesses and strengths in a holistic fashion, before concluding with a discussion of some innovations in academic research that are likely to shape future models.

AB  - DIRECT FIRE EFFECTS ON ANIMALS : Fire probably has no direct effect on Great Basin spadefoots. Adults would stay their burrows during the dry weather associated with fires. Because their environment is aquatic, tadpoles are probably not greatly affected by fire either. HABITAT RELATED FIRE EFFECTS : Research on the effects of fire on Great Basin spadefoots is lacking. Habitat alteration by fire probably has no great impact on Great Basin spadefoots, however. Great Basin spadefoots are not dependent upon vegetation for cover. Fire would alter species composition of their primarily arthropod prey base, but overall numbers of arthropod prey would probably not change. Since Great Basin spadefoots are not dependent upon any particular arthropod species as prey, they are probably able to find food in the postfire environment. Due to runoff, nutrient levels of breeding pools may increase after fire, which could benefit tadpoles by encouraging growth of bacteria, algae, and other tadpole foods. However, high levels of sediment, which may wash into breeding pools as a result of postfire erosion, may adversely impact tadpoles by reducing oxygen levels. Even if fire does render breeding pools in a given basin inhospitable to tadpoles, however, fire proabably has no serious impact on the Great Basin spadefoot population of that basin. A large number of a tadpoles and morphs in a Great Basin spadefoot population succumb to desiccation in most breeding years, with population levels increasing greatly during wet years [3,10]. Since most adults are probably unaffected by fire, Great Basin spadefoot populations probably survive fire by the same reproductive adaptations that enable them to survive drought.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic methodology to derive land-use classes from a remotely sensed data derived land cover map at a scale of 1:200,000. The aim of the study is to better understand the land cover/land-use relationship and to enhance the value of a land cover mapping product for the planning and management of natural resources and/or environmental change studies. In the case of the study, the land cover product is generated using the FAO/UNEP "land cover classification system". The methodology is heavily determined by the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery, the classification system used and the expert knowledge of the study area. For any given land cover the associated land-uses are identified as well as the land cover/land-use relationship. It is assumed that these relations can be of four types: one to one, one to many, many to one or a combination of any of the aforementioned possibilities. The land cover/land-use relation need not be consistent across the study area. The parameters used for land-use classification are based on a comprehensive review of the literature, in which land cover and land-use are usually amalgamated. A set of decision rules was established to define land-use classes. These decision rules were tested during the field survey, after which they were applied to the whole study area. The concurrence of land cover and land-use delineations is discussed for the classes identified. The result of the study is a detailed, flexible land-use data set in which the various parameters used for classification can be re-grouped according to user needs.

AB  - With growing awareness of fire hazard as an environmental threat within tropical rainforests, the state of Brazil initiated a set of fire control policies aimed at monitoring and ameliorating fire hazard in the Amazon region. These policies were developed in the aftermath of large-scale fire events and reflect a conservationist discourse that responded to internal as well as international environmental concerns. In doing so, the policies have framed the “fire problem” around those who use fire in their land use practices, in particular small-scale agriculturalists. Yet, land policy in general has repeatedly failed to address the institutional arrangements which compel small-scale farmers to use fire in their agricultural practices and the underlying development processes that have made the landscape more vulnerable to accidental spread of fire. Using regional level data on small-scale farmers, I suggest that the conservation oriented approach of fire policy may not be enough to curtail accidental fire events and instead that the fire issue needs to be positioned within rural development as well.

AB  - This review explores the role of land use and land use change as a determinant of the soil's ability to sequester and store carbon in the UK. Over 95 percent of the UK land carbon stock is located in soils which are subjected to a range of land uses and global changes. Land use change can result in rapid soil loss of carbon from peatlands, grasslands, plantation forest and native woodland. Soil carbon accumulates more slowly (decadal) but gains can be made when croplands are converted to grasslands, plantation forest or native woodland. The need for land for food production and renewable forms of energy could have considerable influence on UK soil carbon storage in the future. There is a need to recognise the risk of soil carbon losses occurring when land use change to increase carbon storage is offset by compensatory land use conversions elsewhere that result in net carbon release. The protection of peatland and other organic soil carbon stocks, and the management of cropland, grassland and forest soils to increase carbon sequestration, will be crucial to the maintenance of the UK carbon balance. It will be necessary to develop policy to balance trade-offs between soil carbon gains with other land use priorities. These include the sustainable production of food, bio-energy and fibre crops and livestock, water quality and hydrology, greenhouse gas emission control and waste management, all of which are underpinned by the soil. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

It is the contention in this paper that focusing on funding as the strategic forecourt intervention is erroneous, misleading and diversionary. Funding should be the last rear court strategic requirements. One of the biggest problems for northern Uganda has been funding that are: not focussed on strategic intervention to build sustainable peace, recovery and development; funding that are distorting and disorienting the fundamentals of sustainable peace, recovery and development; And there is need for a re-think through the northern Uganda needs and demand for sustainable peace, recovery and development service delivery.

AB  - Fire is an important land management tool for smallholders in the Brazilian Amazon. However, when fires are not properly controlled they can give rise to large-scale wildfires that threaten forests, agricultural plantations, and settlement areas. We use data from a survey of 220 households to examine fire prevention and the scale of fire prevention and burning activities among traditional subsistence households in the Tapaj??s National Forest in Par??, Brazil. We find that in traditional households, economic variables such as the opportunity cost of household time, market conditions, and the hiring wage are important predictors of these decisions, as is household reliance on standing forest resources for non-timber products. Our results confirm that traditional households actively engage in fire prevention, and suggest that fire prevention is motivated by a desire to protect agricultural plantations as well as standing forest reserves. The results suggest that increased income, improved infrastructure, and improved access to markets for labor and agricultural goods will encourage fire prevention among smallholders in communities with education and planning programs. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Landscape patterns and processes reflect both natural ecosystem attributes and the policy and management decisions of individual Federal, State, county, and private organizations. Land-use regulation, water management, and habitat conservation and restoration efforts increasingly rely on landscape-level approaches that incorporate scientific information into the decisionmaking process. Since management actions are implemented to affect future conditions, decision-support models are necessary to forecast potential future conditions resulting from these decisions. Spatially explicit modeling approaches enable testing of different scenarios and help evaluate potential outcomes of management actions in conjunction with natural processes such as climate change. The ability to forecast the effects of changing land use and climate is critically important to land and resource managers since their work is inherently site specific, yet conservation strategies and practices are expressed at higher spatial and temporal scales that must be considered in the decisionmaking process.

AB  - A basic framework for the sensitivity analysis and continuous optimization of integrated land use/transportation model is proposed in this paper. It is shown that separate sensitivity analysis procedures for a land use model with exogenous travel costs and a transportation network with elastic demand can be combined to get a sensitivity analysis procedure for the integrated model. Sensitivity-analysis-based techniques can then be used for the optimal design of land use plans and transportation policies so that certain social surplus functions are optimized. The proposed method is illustrated with a residential location model with a congestible transportation network sub-model.

AB  - The bacterial community structure in soil of a tropical rainforest in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, where forest fires occurred in 1997-1998, was analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) with soil samples collected from the area in 2001 and 2002. The study sites were composed of a control forest area without fire damage, a lightly-burned forest area, and a heavily-burned forest area. DGGE band patterns showed that there were many common bacterial taxa across the areas although the vegetation is not the same. In addition, it was indicated that a change of vegetation in burned areas brought the change in bacterial community structure during 2001-2002. It was also indicated that, depending on a perspective, community structure of soil bacteria in post-fire non-climax forest several years after fire can be more heterogeneous compared with that in unburned climax forest. The dominant soil bacteria in the field of the present study were Acidobacteria, Actinobaceria, and Alphaproteobacteria based on the DNA sequences of DGGE bands, although they were not dominant among the culturable bacteria from the same soil samples.

However, countries grappling with internal political conflict, or that are engaged in military conflicts with neighboring countries, have priorities that focus on control of land in areas where state sovereignty is perceived to be threatened. These two concerns, political-demographic control and environmental protection, create very different paradigms for how to think about open space policy. The objective of this paper is to consider the impact of competing paradigms in land-use policy formulation and implementation-one that encourages sprawl and the other that encourages compact development and the preservation of open space. We use Israel as a case study where both political demography and environmental land-use paradigms are currently influencing policy and planning. We explore the historical evolution of both land-use paradigms and consider how they are currently competing in the formulation and execution of land-use policy decisions. We consider how these distinct priorities are playing out in current discourse and policy implementation, and characterize the past, current and prospective future physical outcomes of policies on the landscape. Our goal is to alert policy makers and land-use scholars of the subtle and contradictory influence of political-demographic land-use priorities with regard to their potential impact on the successful implementation of environmental policies.

AB  - Every aspect of the control of forest fires depends ultimately on the rate at which a fire will spread, and the question of its frontal intensity is not far behind. Fire management, increasingly more sophisticated, desires quantitative answers in place of the old relative indexes. The true scien- tific approach is to begin with the basic chemistry and physics of combustion, link these with fire spread in natural fuel complexes, and eventually produce practical estimates of spread rate, energy output, and growth pattern. By contrast, the "artistic" (or, rather, empirical) approach is to observe fires in the forest, record the attendant burning conditions, describe the fuel complex in some distinguishing sense, and then to derive the necessary regressions. An intriguing result is the tendency of these two approaches to converge to similar final practical states. This idea is illustrated by the past and current fire modelling work in both the United States and Canada. Some future possibilities and roadblocks are explored.

This paper describes the development of a framework to measure and compare the performance of land administration systems. The research is of particular relevance since it develops a management model which links the operational aspects of land administration with land policy.

AB  - This work presents the first structure-based activity prediction model for benzothiadiazines against various genotypes of HCV NS5b polymerase (1a, 1b and 4).The model is a comprehensive workflow of structure-based field template followed by guided docking. The field template was used as a pre-filter and a tool to provide hits in good orientation and position. It was created based on detailed molecular interaction field analysis which includes Topomer CoMFA, grid independent analysis and Superstar. On the other hand, Guided docking was used as a refinement and assessment tool. It was actively directed by two scores: Moldock score as an interaction descriptor (r 2 = 0.65) and a template similarity score as a measure for accurate binding-mode compliance. The docking template was based on energy-based pharmacophore analysis. The whole procedure was formulated and tweaked for both screening (ROC of AUC = 0.91) and activity prediction (r 2 of 0.8) for the genotype 1a. In order to widen the model scope, linear interaction energy was used as a tool for predicting activities of other genotypes based on the docked ligand poses while mutation binding energy was used to investigate the effect of each amino acid mutation in genotype 4. The model was applied for structure-based fragment hopping by screening a library designed by reaction enumeration. A top scoring hit was used to generate a focused library such that it has lower TPSA than the original class ligands and thus better pharmacokinetic properties. After that, experimental validation was carried out by the synthesis of this library and its biological evaluation which yielded compounds that exhibit EC 50 ranging from 1.86 to 23 ??M. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The materials and products used in passenger trains may not be the first ignited element, but during the fire development, these materials, especially ceiling linings and wall coverings, contribute significantly to the fire growth. The fire safety requirements in passenger trains consist mainly of bench-scale tests, with particular focus on the sample geometry, position and fire exposition. When this information is extrapolated to real end use conditions limitations appear.In this paper, a discussion of the use of fire dynamics simulator model and heat release rate experiments in cone calorimeter (bench-scale test) is presented in order to represent the fire development in a passenger train compartment. For the study, two fire scenarios were selected: (1) the single burning item SBI test (modified) and (2) a passenger train compartment. Initially, the limitations of the assumptions and hypothesis made when producing the model were analyzed and the research team carried out a sensitivity study of the model results considering different grid sizes.In order to validate the model, both bench- and full-scale fire tests were considered based on the results provided by the European research program FIRESTARR. The limitations and uncertainties in the results demonstrate the importance of two basic factors: the incident heat flux in the cone calorimeter tests and the prescribed ignition temperature.

Investigations revealed that a crucial role in preventing a fire from turning into a catastrophe was linked to the organization and efficiency of fire fighting services. Findings also revealed that Italian and European legislation introduced the Legislative Decree of 28/10/2005 by the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructures at an Italian level to deal with such incidents. The Legislative Decree aimed at defining precise safety levels that needed to be guaranteed in all newly built tunnels under construction or in operation. It also aimed at introducing the need to carry out a risk analysis for each tunnel to assess the necessity and sufficiency of the safety measures taken or their need for integration.

Autopsy revealed extensive loss of soft tissue and fragmentation of bone, mostly to the trunk region, with partial sparing of the upper trunk, head, and extremities.The decedent had a history of acute and chronic substance abuse and it was reported that he was participating in a methadone program. Toxicology reports of autopsy blood obtained from the heart indicated methadone levels of 0.4 mg/L at the time of his death.There was also a trace amount of cocaine present and there was no ethanol detected. Sustained human combustion, or the "wick effect," is concisely defined as the partial destruction of a body by fire, where the victim's clothing absorbs liquefied fatty tissue and acts like a wick of a candle by perpetuating a flame that slowly destroys the body with heat.

AB  - Two models that can be used to predict full-scale heat release rates of polyurethane foam slabs were evaluated in this study. Predictions were compared with results of furniture calorimeter tests of 10 cm thick polyurethane foam specimens which were ignited in the centre or on the edge. Furniture calorimeter results indicated that peak heat release rates and fire growth rates were higher during centre ignition tests than edge ignition tests. For both situations, the growth phase of the heat release rate curves measured in the full-scale tests was successfully predicted using t 2 design fires; the choice of a specific t 2 fire depended on the surface area of the specimen and ignition location. A model originally developed during the European Combustion Behaviour of Upholstered Furniture (CBUF) project was also evaluated using heat release rate data from cone calorimeter tests and flame area burning rates measured using infrared video records of the furniture calorimeter tests. This model was able to successfully predict the initial growth phase of the fires and predictions of peak heat release rates were within 17% of measured values. The model had less success in predicting heat release rates later in the growth phase and during the decay phase of the fires, and did not appear to capture all of the physics of the full-scale tests, in particular foam melting and subsequent liquid pool burning. As the model did show promise, future work is planned to address these shortcomings and to develop improved flame spread models for polyurethane foam.

AB  - The relationship between heat release rate and other fire reaction properties of fibre reinforced polymer composite materials is investigated. The heat release rate and fire reaction properties of thermoset matrix composites reinforced with combustible fibres (aramid, extended-chain polyethylene) or non-combustible fibres (glass, carbon) were determined over a range of heat flux levels using the oxygen consumption cone calorimeter technique. The fire reaction properties that were measured were time-to-ignition, smoke density, carbon monoxide yield, carbon dioxide yield, mass loss rate and total mass loss. It is discovered that these reaction properties (apart from ignition time) are linearly related to the heat release rate for composites containing non-combustible fibres. When the reinforcement is combustible, however, the heat release rate only appears to be related to the carbon monoxide yield, mass loss rate and (in some cases) smoke density. This study clearly shows the importance of the relationship between heat release rate with smoke density and carbon monoxide yield, the two reaction properties that influence the survival of humans in fire.

AB  - Land use is a key driver of global environmental change. Unless major shifts in consumptive behaviours occur, land-based production will have to increase drastically to meet future demands for food and other commodities. To better understand the drivers and impacts of agricultural intensification, identifying global, archetypical patterns of land systems is needed. However, current approaches focus on broad-scale representations of dominant land cover with limited consideration of land-use intensity. In this study, we derived a new global representation of land systems based on more than 30 high-resolution datasets on land-use intensity, environmental conditions and socioeconomic indicators. Using a self-organizing map algorithm, we identified and mapped twelve archetypes of land systems for the year 2005. Our analysis reveals unexpected similarities in land systems across the globe but the diverse pattern at sub-national scales implies that there are no ‘one-size-fits-all’ solutions to sustainable land management. Our results help to identify generic patterns of land pressures and environmental threats and provide means to target regionalized strategies to cope with the challenges of global change. Mapping global archetypes of land systems represents a first step towards better understanding the driving forces and environmental and social outcomes of land system dynamics.

AB  - This special issue includes nine research papers and forum articles that span both ecological and sociological aspects of managing fire in the southwest. The first paper explores the interacting roles of topography, vegetation, and climate in a sky island mountain range of southern Arizona. The second one presents results of greenhouse and field studies designed to assess whether aqueous smoke promotes plant emergence in 61 plant species commonly found in ponderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa) forests in this region. The next two papers address fire and invasive species in central New Mexico. The other papers explore how the invasion of an African bunchgrass, Lehmann lovegrass ( Eragrostis lehmanniana), influences the effects of fire on small mammals, and present an approach to estimate other societal benefits of vegetation in a wildland-urban interface, including air pollution removal and carbon sequestration and storage. A short communication summarizes post-fire impacts 43 years after a prescribed burn in ponderosa pine forest. The special issue concludes with four forum articles. The first two describes how ranchers and staff from both state and federal agencies and The Nature Conservancy are collaborating to reintroduce fire in the southern borderlands to improve landscape productivity and biological diversity, and a process for incorporating information on recent fires and insect outbreaks in state-and-transition models using an example from northern Arizona. The final two forum papers relating to the Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) programme and new tools that have been designed or modified for BAER team use and make a case for the need for longer term monitoring of recovering ecosystems.

AB  - The forest fire in Mt. Carmel National Park in Israel in 1989 resembled the 1988 fire in Yellowstone Park in that public concern motivated the authorities to appoint professional committees to assess rehabilitation options and fire policies. The committees re-evaluated the goals and practices of nature conservation and management in protected areas, in a much broader context than just fire prevention. The recognition of the dynamic nature of ecosystems, the low predictability of their behaviour, and the role of fire as a disturbance agent that promotes biodiversity, contributed to recommendations of minimal intervention, allowing self-regeneration. The Israeli committee commissioned an interdisciplinary-research program designed to direct post-fire and fire-reduction management, and provide insights for planning for the region as a biosphere reserve. The results of this three-year program are reported in this issue.

AB  - A method is proposed that planners and stakeholders can use to select an optimal land use plan that balances the socioeconomic benefits and environmental costs of regional growth. It entails seven steps: (1) specifying alternative growth futures; (2) formulating land use policies to alleviate potential adverse environmental impacts of alternative futures; (3) evaluating socioeconomic and environmental impacts (outcomes) with land use policies and alternative futures; (4) using a multiple attribute utility function to score outcomes and rank land use plans based on those scores; (5) determining an optimal plan for stakeholders based on some decision criterion; (6) employing a conflict resolution method to resolve stakeholder disagreements about optimal plans; and (7) using passive adaptive management to determine whether an implemented plan remains optimal over time. The proposed method is demonstrated for a hypothetical case study that incorporates: (1) low, medium, and high future growth rates for major industries in a region; (2) unrestrictive, moderately restrictive, and highly restrictive land use policies that limit the location and density of residential and non-residential development; (3) economic output and habitat fragmentation attributes of outcomes; (4) a linear additive, multiple attribute utility function; (5) pro-development, neutral, and pro-environment stakeholder preferences for attributes; and (6) optimal plan selection based on the maximin principle. Results for the hypothetical case study indicate that the ranking of the three plans and the optimal plan differ across the three stakeholder groups, and the optimal collective plan varies depending on which conflict resolution method is used and whether the assessment is ex ante or ex post. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It entails seven steps: (1) specifying alternative growth futures; (2) formulating land use policies to alleviate potential adverse environmental impacts of alternative futures; (3) evaluating socioeconomic and environmental impacts (outcomes) with land use policies and alternative futures; (4) using a multiple attribute utility function to score outcomes and rank land use plans based on those scores; (5) determining an optimal plan for stakeholders based on some decision criterion; (6) employing a conflict resolution method to resolve stakeholder disagreements about optimal plans; and (7) using passive adaptive management to determine whether an implemented plan remains optimal over time. The proposed method is demonstrated for a hypothetical case study that incorporates: (1) low, medium, and high future growth rates for major industries in a region; (2) unrestrictive, moderately restrictive, and highly restrictive land use policies that limit the location and density of residential and non-residential development; (3) economic output and habitat fragmentation attributes of outcomes; (4) a linear additive, multiple attribute utility function; (5) pro-development, neutral, and pro-environment stakeholder preferences for attributes; and (6) optimal plan selection based on the maximin principle. Results for the hypothetical case study indicate that the ranking of the three plans and the optimal plan differ across the three stakeholder groups, and the optimal collective plan varies depending on which conflict resolution method is used and whether the assessment is ex ante or ex post. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fire hazard studies of clean room facilities indicated that significant losses due to fire may occur in the semiconductor industry. The present study reports the results of full-scale wet bench fire tests conducted (1) to assess the fire hazards of existing wet bench materials not meeting the listing requirement of NFPA 318, (2) to assess the impact on wet bench fires of engineered materials with improved flammability characteristics, and (3) to compare the observed fire behavior with the results of simpler small- and intermediate-scale fire tests using the same materials. The full-scale wet bench fires were observed to be consistent in terms of chemical heat release rate, fire propagation, and smoke generation with the results of the small- and intermediate-scale test results. The simpler fire tests are incorporated in FM Approvals 4910 certification for materials to be used in semiconductor fabrication facilities. The small-scale test protocol is also standardized in NFPA 287.

Turner et al.

The primary concern is the relationship between land tenure and economic development, and land reform and the distribution of income, wealth and power. The main findingthat dispersed ownership and management correlate with economic developmentis unsurprising. But it is more difficult to assess how conditions which are conducive to maximal production come about, or how a society shifts from concentrated power over land and labour to a dispersed tenure system.

AB  - Carbonaceous aerosols are emitted by combustion sources and may influence the climate by altering the radiation balance of the atmosphere. Carbonaceous particles exist mainly in the accumulation mode and thus may be transported over long distances. The present study deals with the impact of anthropogenic activity associated with accidental fires on the black carbon aerosol concentrations over an urban environment, namely Hyderabad, India. Black carbon aerosol loading in association with meteorological parameters on a normal day, an accident day and a post-accident day have been analysed. Diurnal variations of black carbon aerosols on a normal day suggest that black carbon aerosol concentrations increased by a factor of about 2 during morning and evening hours compared with afternoon hours. A drastic increase in black carbon aerosol loading was found during an accident day compared with a normal day. An immediate return to normal black carbon concentration was found during the post-accident day. Black carbon aerosol loading in relation to rainfall is also discussed in the paper.

AB  - Degradation of natural resources in Haiti has been a growing concern to foresters, environmentalists, and local populations. Various approaches based on "participatory", "fines and taxes" and "command and control" regulations, have been unsuccessfully implemented to persuade farm households to adopt conservation measures. Negative impacts on the welfare of farmers limit the efficiency of these approaches for forest conservation. This paper investigates alternative solutions to the problem of deforestation of Haiti using linear programming (LP) models. More specifically, this study evaluates the role of various policy instruments on large-income farm households and low-income farm households' welfare and forest conservation in Haiti. Data from 243 farmers inside the For??t of the For??t des Pins Reserve are used in the empirical analysis. Results suggest that agricultural subsidies tied to environmental conservation would promote a more sustainable resource use in For??t des Pins Reserve. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this research was to identify the factors responsible for residential and industrial/commercial land development in Lagos between 1984 and 2000. Land use changes were mapped using satellite images, while binary logistic regression was used to model the probability of observing urban development as a function of spatially explicit independent variables. Accessibility, spatial interaction effects and policy variables were the major determinants of land use change. Variables that influenced residential development were not necessarily those responsible for the expansion of industrial/commercial land areas. The evidence of frontier residential development calls for land tenure and housing development reforms, and land use controls to minimize the environmental consequences of unplanned urban expansion. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Forest fires are a major contributor of gaseous and particulate compounds to the atmosphere, impairing air quality and affecting human health. A new forest fire emissions module was developed and integrated into the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS), which systematically compiles, since 2000, series of burnt area statistics mapped from satellite imagery. This new forest fire emission model was built on classical methodologies of fuel-map based emission estimation that were improved, especially on burning efficiency, fuel consumption estimation and emission factors. It makes the best use of EFFISnear-real time and detailed information on forest fires, mainly concerning products with a high temporal resolution, which is needed to simulate smoke dispersion and chemical transformation in the atmosphere.A case study of a forest fire event in the north of Portugal on October 14, 2011, with a total of 4400ha of burnt area, was selected to test this forest fire emission model. The fine scale information used in this study included: (1) 3-hresolution meteorological fields; (2) daily evolution of the cumulative fire perimeter from the EFFIS rapid damage assessment system; and (3) a fine spatial resolution fuel map, forest type map and topography. The 3-hevolution of pollutant emissions was calculated for gas and particulate species based on the evolution of the burnt area increase and fuel consumption. The estimated forest fire emissions represent more than 90% of the total annual (anthropogenic and natural) emissions over the study region. The impact of these forest fire emissions was analyzed in terms of air quality, using observational data from the nearest air quality monitoring station. High peaks of NO2 and SO2 were registered simultaneously during the period 06-09a.m. and a later peak of PM from 07a.m. to 15p.m. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Question: Is post-fire, medium-term vegetation dynamics determined by land-use or fire history prior to fire? Location: South-facing slope in the Gallinera valley, Alicante province, eastern Spain. Methods: After mapping the land-use and fire history of the study site using photo-interpretation, we sampled vegetation structure on a set of plots representing the most frequent land-use and fire history combinations on an area burned six years before sampling. We studied the effects of land-use history, comparing the one-fire land-use trajectories. We analysed the effects of fire history; comparing one-and two-fire plots for both previously cropped and uncropped areas. Results: Most variables were not significantly different between the earliest abandoned plots ( abandoned at least 38 years before the fire) and the uncropped plots. On the most recently abandoned plots ( abandoned between one and four years before the fire), the therophyte richness and the ratio of seeder: resprouter richness were significantly greatest. Different fire recurrences did not determine different post-fire vegetation on either the uncropped or the early abandoned plots ( all dominated by fire-recruited seeder shrubs). The most recently abandoned plots had a lower resilience to fire. Conclusions: Land-use history and recent pre-fire land use, in particular, determined the post-fire vegetation in the medium term. The vegetation composition converged during secondary succession among land-use histories. Increasing fire recurrence had a small effect on mature plant communities, due to the combination of life-history traits determining the response to fire of the dominant species.

AB  - Multiple factors interact to influence fire behavior.  While the interactions of fuel moisture and fuel loading in western coniferous communities are well understood, few studies have examined fire behavior in eastern deciduous forests.  In order to accurately predict fire behavior in mixed-oak forests, studies need to examine fire behavior in eastern deciduous forests.  We conducted a fine-scale manipulative experiment to determine the specific effects that fine fuel moisture and load have on fire behavior in Ohio mixed-oak forests.  Three fuel moisture levels (0, 4 and 15% moisture), and five field-simulated fuel loads were burned in a 3X5 factorial experiment.  Thermocolor pyrometers were used to measure maximum termperature at 5 and 30 cm as an indicator of fire behavior.  Additionally, amount and percent of fuel burned were determined for each set of conditions.  As expected, fires burned hotter with decreasing fuel moisture, and with increasing fuel load.  Percent of fuel burned an dmean temperature at 5 and 30 cm were found in prior field studies in Appalachian Ohio.  Controlled experiments such as this will likely prove useful in future efforts to link fuel conditions and fire behavior as landscape-scale effects are modeled.  In particular, our results can be used to verify and calibrate fire behavior models in eastern mixed-oak forests.

The active land rental market accounted for about one-third of cultivated land. Patterns of land rental transactions, and tests of the importance of insecurity in renting land, where the owner may not be able to reclaim land rented out, do not support the presumption that rental markets perform poorly. The role of the sheikh as administrator of village land, and the claims of large landowners to vast tracts, are, however, important political problems that must be resolved before attempts at 'rationalizing' land tenure.

AB  - Monsoon rainforests form an archipelago of small habitat fragments throughout the wet-dry tropics of northern Australia. According to one definition the current monsoon rainforest mammal assemblage contains only one rainforest specialist mammal species (restricted to Cape York Peninsula), and is dominated by eutherian habitat generalists (murids and bats) that mostly occur in surrounding savanna habitats. The mammal assemblages in monsoon rainforests across northern Australia (Cape York Peninsula, Northern Territory and the Kimberley) are essentially regional subsets of the local savanna and mangrove mammal assemblages, and consequently share only a limited number of species in common (most of which are bats). The lack of rainforest specialists in north western Australia is believed to be due to lack of large tracts (> 1000 ha) of monsoon rainforest habitat, the possible substantial contraction of these habitats in the past and the limited extent of gallery rainforests: gallery rainforests in South American savannas are important habitats for rainforest mammals. Unfortunately it is not possible to identify the threshold of habitat area required to maintain populations of rainforest specialist mammal species because of an impoverished fossil record pertaining to the past spatial distribution of monsoon rainforests. The implications of the lack of Australian monsoon rainforest specialist mammal fauna for the future of heavily fragmented tropical rainforests elsewhere in the world is briefly discussed. It is concluded that the analogy of habitat fragments to true islands is weak, that rainforest plant species are less vulnerable to local extinction than mammals, and that the loss of mammal rainforest specialists may not result in a dramatic loss of plant species.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic methodology to derive land-use classes from a remotely sensed data derived land cover map at a scale of 1:200,000. The aimof the study is to better understand the land cover/land-use relationship and to enhance the value of a land cover mapping product for the planning and management of natural resources and/or environmental change studies. In the case of the study, the land cover product is generated using the FAO/UNEP ‘‘land cover classification system’’. The methodology is heavily determined by the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery, the classification system used and the expert knowledge of the study area. For any given land cover the associated land-uses are identified as well as the land cover/land-use relationship. It is assumed that these relations can be of four types: one to one, one to many, many to one or a combination of any of the aforementioned possibilities. The land cover/land-use relation need not be consistent across the study area. The parameters used for land-use classification are based on a comprehensive review of the literature, in which land cover and land-use are usually amalgamated. A set of decision rules was established to define land-use classes. These decision rules were tested during the field survey, after which they were applied to the whole study area. The concurrence of land cover and land-use delineations is discussed for the classes identified. The result of the study is a detailed, flexible land-use data set in which the various parameters used for classification can be re-grouped according to user needs.

AB  - The Late Devonian mass extinction occurred in a stepwise manner and culminated close to the Frasnian-Famennian (F-F) boundary (372. million years ago). Organic-molecular indices from marine sedimentary rocks at the Sinsin section, Belgium, indicate that the sequence of combustion of land vegetation, soil erosion, and anoxia-euxinia occurred close to this boundary. The increased concentrations of biomarkers indicating forest fire and soil erosion measured in the Sinsin section suggest that fire became widespread at this time, leading to various damaging consequences (increased runoff and oceanic anoxia) that caused marine extinctions. Magnetic susceptibility data in the Sinsin section indicate a relatively dry climate spanning the F-F boundary, which would have encouraged forest fires. The study of organic biomarkers presents several lines of evidence to link forest fire and soil erosion to the Late Devonian mass extinction. We find a forest fire and soil erosion event during the Devonian mass extinction. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The myth of an unbroken primeval forest, extending across eastern North America at the dawn of European settlement, has been perpetuated in the writings of both laymen and scholars throughout the present century. Accounts of sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth century explorers, however, document vast amounts of cleared land held by aboriginal inhabitants, who likely populated the continent in much higher numbers than have been traditionally accepted. Fire was the principal tool used by the Indians to clear vegetation. Despite frequent historical reference to the Indian use of iire and the documentation of Indian old fields, the role of lire has been largely underplayed. Fire was implemented for forest management, driving game, and preparing land for agriculture.

AB  - Integration of a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm with economic optimisation, important when dynamics of disturbances and of the process are comparable (the problem encountered in many practical applications), is considered in the paper. The case when the process has more manipulated variables than controlled outputs is especially interesting since additional degrees of freedom are available, e.g. when it is sufficient for some of the output variables to be bounded instead of controlled. The idea of the proposed approach is to integrate the economic optimisation and MPC algorithm into one computationally efficient optimisation problem. The steady-state model of the process is approximated on-line at each algorithm iteration taking into account the current state of the plant. As a result, an easy to solve quadratic programming task is obtained. Linear and linear-quadratic approximations are used.

AB  - The publication of the Brundtland Report in 1987 has led to worldwide concern over sustainable development. Sustainable development is particularly important to regions that are undergoing rapid economic development, such as the Pearl River Delta and other rapidly developing regions in China, Malaysia, Thailand and Asia. Geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing are useful tools in the formulation, implementation and monitoring of urban development in the move towards a sustainable development strategy. Since the adoption of economic reform in China in 1978, cities in the Pearl River Delta are developing very rapidly. Economic growth is around 20% a year, making it one of the highest growth areas in the world. Accompanying economic development is rapid urban growth. This paper attempts to demonstrate the application of the integration of GIS and remote sensing in urban growth management in the Pearl River Delta by using them to monitor and evaluate land development. Remote sensing techniques are used to carry out land-use change detection by using multi-temporal remote sensing data. Land-use change impact analysis is further carried out by the integration of GIS and remote sensing. © 1997 Carfax Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Extensive tropical peatlands are located in the Malaysian and Indonesian lowlands, particularly in Borneo, Sumatra, West Papua, and Peninsular Malaysia. In an undisturbed condition, these peatlands make a significant contribution to terrestrial carbon storage, both in terms of their aboveground biomass (peat swamp forest) and thick deposits of peat. Occasional forest fires, including peatland fires, have occurred in Southeast Asia over several millennia but, in recent years, they have become a more regular feature. The most severe fires have been linked with the El Nino phase of ENSO which causes extended periods of drought, particularly across the peatland areas of southern Sumatra and Southern Kalimantan. During the last 20 years, rapid land use change, exacerbated by climatic variability, has led to an increase in fire frequency, as the remaining peat swamp forests come under pressure from increased illegal logging, development for plantations and agriculture-based settlement, and, where economic development has failed, land abandonment. A case study of fire occurrence in Borneo illustrates that peat swamp forests are much more prone to fire than any other forest type, largely as a result of the high pressure being put on these last remaining forested lands. From studies in central Kalimantan (southern Borneo), we demonstrate the relationships between peat drainage, vegetation change, and increased fire frequency, including the role that peat combustion and subsidence play in an increased incidence of surface flooding. Tropical peatland fires, and the changes in vegetation that they bring about, have significant impacts on the atmosphere, the carbon cycle, and various ecosystem services; they also cause wide-ranging social and economic impacts. Fires on peatlands usually affect both the surface vegetation and the underlying peat layer and, as a result, they release much larger amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere than forest fires on mineral soils. In 1997, peatland fires in Indonesia resulted in the release of between 0.81 Gt and 2.57 Gt of carbon into the atmosphere, equivalent to 13% to 40% of mean annual global carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and over the last ten years a conservative estimate of total carbon emissions from peatland fires in Southeast Asia is of the order of 2 Gt to 3 Gt. Future climate changes may place further pressure on the tropical peatland ecosystem and are likely to lead to enhanced carbon emissions from both peat degradation and fire.

AB  - Advances in fire climatology have derived from recent studies of modern and paleoecological records. We convened a series of workshops and a conference session to report and review regional-scale findings, and these meetings led to the 10 papers in this special issue. Two papers focus on fire and climate patterns in the modern era using documentary records, four papers utilise tree rings to evaluate recent centuries of change, and four papers evaluate charcoal and pollen in lake, bog, and alluvial sediments over the Holocene. Here we summarise some of the key findings from these papers in the context of other recent fire climatology literature. These studies illustrate the value of long-term perspectives and spatial networks of fire and climate data in discovering the patterns and modes of past fire regime and climate variations.

AB  - Landscape forest flammability and regional biomass burning are critical environmental issues associated to fire use practices in the Brazilian Amazon. To better understand the gamut of these issues, all land use pathways that lead to fire use and culminate in different fire types must be investigated. An estimated 400,000 smallholders use fire in their land use practices, but most research has investigated connections between land use decisions and subsequent fire on large-scale cattle ranches only. This study presents research on smallholder fire use practices in the agricultural frontier south of Santarem, Para. Vegetation vulnerable to smallholder fires is largely secondary succession, while only ~8% is logged or mature forest cover. Fire efficiency in smallholder fire use practices is slightly higher than in previous studies used to estimate regional biomass burning, averaging 46.7-57.5%. In slashed succession areas, average efficiency also increases as biomass fuel load increases, but range increases as well, suggesting that smallholders may have more control over efficiency outcome in younger slashed succession areas than older slashed succession, logged areas or mature forests.

AB  - We explore the degree to which the consideration of infectious diseases may be of importance in the formulation of land use policy. We look at the diseases of humans, domestic livestock and wild vertebrates, and distinguish two types of human disease: those which form epidemics involving transmission from person to person, and those which are contracted from non-human sources and spread very little through the population. Land use affects the density and distribution of people, and urbanisation typically increases the risk of an epidemic and the speed with which it spreads. More subtle effects may occur through changes in the network of contacts between individuals. Land use policy that affects the distribution of breeding sites for disease vectors (e.g. mosquitoes) or the passage of potential pathogenic microorganisms through the environment from farm animals to humans can also influence non-epidemic disease risk. Livestock disease is critically affected by stocking density and the network of contacts between individuals and herds. Land use and agricultural policy can be very important in reducing the risks of disease outbreaks. We explore the complex relationship between intensification and disease risks. We suspect that land use policy may affect the viability of threatened species of vertebrates, though our relatively poor knowledge of disease epidemiology in wild animals makes policy formation difficult. Though climate change may act together with land use policy to determine disease risk, we consider this interaction to less important than that between land use and the socioeconomic drivers of global change. We conclude by assessing the importance of disease in the three types of host to land use policy. We suggest that the consideration of wildlife diseases is a low to medium priority for land use policy, though we attach high uncertainty to our conclusion; the consideration of human diseases we think a low priority (with medium uncertainty); while that of livestock diseases we argue is a high priority (with low uncertainty). ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - The rich nations will be tempted to respond to the problems caused by the greenhouse effect by throwing energy at them, the author argues. This would be not only blind but increasingly difficult, because energy supplies are peculiarly vulnerable to rises in world sea levels. Moreover these changes are likely to be sudden rather than steady and progressive, and they are already underway. Many existing energy sources probably cannot be rescued. The only sensible strategy is a crash programme of energy conservation, decommissioning equipment and installations that burn fossil fuel, with all the land use implications that follow.

AB  - Based on previous work, screen-printing technology was used to elaborate an improved integrated piezoelectric structure relatively to a reference sample [Marechal, et. al., 2000], An active PZT layer doped with PGO to lower sintering temperature at 800degC was printed on a porous unpoled PZT substrate which was chosen to withstand such a temperature. Moreover, the acoustical impedance of this substrate is close to that of the deposited piezoelectric thick film, making it an adequate backing for a wideband device. Thus, a short pulse-echo response is obtained, but the resonance frequency is lowered. Additional layers such as a back electrode and a dense barrier layer were interposed between the substrate and the piezoelectric film. These passive and active layers have a significant influence on the performance of the high frequency transducer. Therefore, their thickness and acoustic properties must be controlled precisely for an optimization of the structure. The center frequency and active source radius of the transducer were increased in comparison to the reference sample, resulting in an improved radiation pattern. In vivo human skin images were performed with an imaging system for two of the prototype broadband high frequency transducer

AB  - Over the past centuries, land systems in Italy experienced fundamental shifts, owing to the availability of new energy forms, population surges, and technological progress. The 20th century was characterized by massive productivity increases, accompanied by gradual land abandonment and the return of forest land. We here analyze 120 years of land system change in Italy, applying the human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) framework, a metric for socio-economic pressures on terrestrial ecosystems. HANPP allows integrating ecological with societal perspectives, by systematically quantifying (a) biomass harvest and (b) the difference between potential productivity of ecosystems and current productivity induced by land use processes, such as land conversion, or land degradation. Besides assessing national trends we calculated HANPP separately for the Italian North and South between 1934 and 2007, in order to scrutinize if high regional discrepancies in terms of natural and socio-economic preconditions translate into diverging land system trajectories. Our results show that national HANPP has been declining from 78% of natural productivity before WWII to 56% in 2007, indicating a declining land -use induced pressure on biomass flows over time. Simultaneously, biomass harvest increased by around 26% due to agricultural intensification, despite shrinking croplands. Although we found a significant difference between the Northern and Southern region in the absolute levels of several land use indicators related to biomass appropriation, the overarching trends of land system change were remarkably similar in both regions. This suggests that underlying drivers of land system change, such as policies aimed at land-use intensification and structural change were equally dominating land system trajectories in the North and South of Italy, not withstanding their socio-ecological divergences. ?? 2014 The Authors.

AB  - This study developed models that relate trip lengths to the land-use characteristics at the trip ends (both production and attraction ends). Separate models were developed by trip purpose. The results indicate several statistically significant and intuitively reasonable effects of land-use patterns. High residential densities and a good mix of complementary land uses are associated with shorter trips. Larger establishments attract longer trips, and the lengths of home-based other trips decrease with an increase in the number of convenient commercial land- use parcels in the neighborhood. The connectivity provided by the roadway network and the urban form of the area (measured in terms of number of intersections and cul-de-sacs) affect trip lengths. In addition to the local land-use characteristics, trip lengths also vary significantly by the location of the neighborhood within the region. All these results hold even after controlling for several trip and traveler characteristics. The models have been implemented in a spreadsheet program for use in assessing the transportation impacts of new land developments.

AB  - The decade since the initiation of the Land-Use/Cover Change (LUCC) project in 1995 (see Chap. 1) has witnessed considerable\n  advances in the field of modeling of land-use/cover change. The science plan of the project indicated that the major task\n  would be the development of a new generation of land-use/cover change models capable of simulating the major socioeconomic\n  and biophysical driving forces of land-use and land-cover change. In addition, these models were supposed to be able to handle\n  interactions at several spatial and temporal scales. Recent publications indicate that the LUCC science community has successfully\n  met this challenge and a wide range of advanced models, aiming at different scales and research questions, is now available\n  (Briassoulis 2000; Agarwal et al. 2001; Veldkamp and Lambin 2001; Parker et al. 2003; Nagendra et al. 2004; Veldkamp and Verburg\n  2004; Verburg et al. 2004b; Verburg and Veldkamp 2005). One of the most important observations that can be made examining\n  the range of available land-use/ cover change models is the wide variety of approaches and concepts underlying the models.\n  This chapter intends to describe the variety of modeling approaches, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches\n  and indicate the remaining challenges for the land-use science community. Not being able to discuss all individual models\n  and approaches, we will focus on broad distinctions between approaches and discuss how modelers have dealt with a number of\n  important aspects of the functioning of the landuse system. A land-use system is understood here as a type of land use with\n  interrelated determining factors with strong functional relations with each other (see Fig. 1.2). These factors include a\n  wide range of land-use influencing factors than can be biophysical, economic, social, cultural, political, or institutional.\n  The discussion of modeling approaches in this chapter is illustrated with examples of models and results from selected research\n  projects.

AB  - Preferential clearance of productive Acacia-dominated ecosystems was determined using digital land-system mapping and a 1994-1995 native vegetation remnant coverage from central Queensland. The previously mapped land systems are composed of complexes of land units, covering a range of productive potentials that are not individually mapped but defined according to their proportions within the land systems. Some land units were grouped into 11 `Acacia ecosystems' composed of unique combinations of geology and vegetation dominated by brigalow (Acacia harpophylla F.Muell. ex Benth.), gidgee (A. cambagei R.T.Baker) or blackwood (A. argyrodendron Domin). Calculation of the remnant area of these Acacia ecosystems, assuming equal proportions of vegetation clearance of the land unit components within the land-system complexes (equal proportion calculation), was compared with a more accurate calculation based on interpretation of aerial photography (aerial-photograph calculation) data. The aerial photograph calculation of remnant area was 44% of the equal proportion calculation for brigalow on Tertiary clay and the ratio between these calculations was greater than 100% for only one Acacia ecosystem of relatively low production potential. The proportion of the remnant Acacia ecosystems relative to less productive ecosystems on tenures assigned to production (leasehold and freehold) was consistently lower than on other tenures. The use of mapping consisting of composite ecosystems with various production potentials for area-based assessment of vegetation clearance will overestimate the remnant areas of the relatively productive types unless a procedure such as that outlined here is used to correct for preferential clearance. This study provides near-complete and accurate data on the 1994-1995 status of Acacia ecosystems in central Queensland. Relative to their original area, values ranged from 6.8% for brigalow on Tertiary clay to 37.6% for gidgee-blackwood on alluvium.

AB  - "Monitoring Family Planning Programs 1996," a wallchart produced by the Carolina Population Center at the University of Chapel Hill in collaboration with the Population Reference Bureau, compiles most of the available data regarding family planning programs in 96 developing countries and presents the evaluation indicators in a comparative overview. Data on government spending, types of services available, facilities, and the number of new contraceptive users served each year are included. Key findings include the following information. Although most governments are concerned about high birth rates (80% of governments in Africa and over 50% of governments in Latin America), West Asian governments (Iraq, Jordan, Yemen, and Syria) consider the high fertility rates there to be satisfactory and have not promoted family planning. In East Asia, where family planning has been established for decades, fertility has decreased below replacement level. In spite of governmental concern, family planning effort lags in many countries; of the 95 countries with family planning effort scores, only 41 received moderate or strong scores (50-92% of the maximum score possible). These included 62% of Latin American countries, 23% of African countries, and just over 50% of Asian countries. National and international spending is often insufficient. The highest annual per capita expenditure by a government on family planning services occurs in Mauritius (US $1.65 per person); Afghanistan, Brazil, the Congo, Honduras, Iran, Paraguay, Uganda, and Zaire spend less than US $0.01 per person. Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mauritius, Tunisia, and Zimbabwe spend a total per capita, from all sources, of US $1 or more. Almost 50% of the married women in developing countries use a modern form of contraception; 17% of married women of reproductive age in Africa do so (11% in sub-Saharan Africa, and 36% in North Africa). Contraceptive prevalence in Latin America is 53%; in Asia it ranges from 34% in South Central Asia to 78% in East Asia. Service providers may be too few in number. The ratio of married women, ages 15-44, per staff member ranges from 111,235 in the Ivory Coast to 109 in Viet Nam. Of the 38 countries that have more than 1000 women per staff member, 16 are in Africa, 12 are in Latin America, and 10 are in Asia.

AB  - Many tropical countries have recently implemented similar forest policies including large-scale afforestation programmes and the devolution of land-use rights. Their success in enhancing livelihoods and contributing to improved environmental services has been widely questioned. This paper discusses the impacts of state afforestation efforts and forestry land allocation on farmers' land-use decisions in northern Vietnam. It links policy outcomes with factors located beyond the local level by analysing the decision-making process at the policy implementation stage. Our study suggests that the current national afforestation campaign has not successfully involved households in the forestry sector and that forestry land allocation to households has often disrupted existing land-use systems with little impact on afforestation. These discrepancies between policy intentions and outcomes are partly linked to the relative freedom provinces have to interpret and adapt policies during the implementation stage. In this respect, the political and economic context has played a significant role in providing particular financial and bureaucratic incentives to the former State Forest Enterprises and to civil servants. However, we argue that these actors have been allowed or even encouraged to take advantage of these incentives by national policy-makers thanks to: (1) the lack of clarity or the poor adequacy of the policies designed at the central level, and (2) the blurred character of prevailing national discourses promoting afforestation and community-based forest management. We recommend that national policy-makers allow flexibility in policy implementation but develop mechanisms of accountability and control between the provincial and the central authorities. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - FtsH is a cytoplasmic membrane-integrated, ATP-dependent metalloprotease, which processively degrades both cytoplasmic and membrane proteins in concert with unfolding. The FtsH protein is divided into the N-terminal transmembrane region and the larger C-terminal cytoplasmic region, which consists of an ATPase domain and a protease domain. We have determined the crystal structures of the Thermus thermophilus FtsH ATPase domain in the nucleotide-free and AMP-PNP- and ADP-bound states, in addition to the domain with the extra preceding segment. Combined with the mapping of the putative substrate binding region, these structures suggest that FtsH internally forms a hexameric ring structure, in which ATP binding could cause a conformational change to facilitate transport of substrates into the protease domain through the central pore.

AB  - Future changes in land Use in the coastal zone will be dominated by the effects of climate change. The major effect of climate change on the coastal zone will be clue to increasing sea level which, in combination with possible increases in the frequency and intensity of storms, will bring about: change in patterns of erosion and sedimentation increased risk of flooding change in the distribution and types of coastal habitats. The coastline has always been subject to change through erosion and other natural Processes. Climate change may speed this change. This will mean profound impacts on low-lying coastal areas over the next 50 years, particularly along the eastern coast of England. These physical changes in the coastal zone will occur alongside, and interact with. a variety of human impacts and drivers of change. Agricultural policy reform, and changes in production in response to this and to climate change, will alter coastal landscapes as well as sediment and nutrient inputs into coastal waters. Demographic change - an increasing UK population, who are on average older and who potentially have more leisure time - will be likely to bring about an increased demand for the recreational opportunities that the coast provides.

AB  - Future changes in land Use in the coastal zone will be dominated by the effects of climate change. The major effect of climate change on the coastal zone will be clue to increasing sea level which, in combination with possible increases in the frequency and intensity of storms, will bring about: change in patterns of erosion and sedimentation increased risk of flooding change in the distribution and types of coastal habitats. The coastline has always been subject to change through erosion and other natural Processes. Climate change may speed this change. This will mean profound impacts on low-lying coastal areas over the next 50 years, particularly along the eastern coast of England. These physical changes in the coastal zone will occur alongside, and interact with. a variety of human impacts and drivers of change. Agricultural policy reform, and changes in production in response to this and to climate change, will alter coastal landscapes as well as sediment and nutrient inputs into coastal waters. Demographic change - an increasing UK population, who are on average older and who potentially have more leisure time - will be likely to bring about an increased demand for the recreational opportunities that the coast provides. This will mean more demand for land for housing and recreational facilities. A continuing trend of rising income levels may also fuel further demand for imported goods and hence the need for further port development, particularly in the south east of England.

AB  - Surgical fire is a rare complication during the operative period. But, it is a severe complication when it occurs. There are antiseptic agents with strong inflammability used for skin preparation. We report accidental skin burns caused by the spark of electric cautery. The patient was a 29-year-old (50 kg, 158 cm, physical status ASA1) woman who underwent laparotomy for acute abdomen. Anesthesia was induced and tracheal intubation was performed without trouble. Anesthesia was maintained with oxygen, air, remifentanil and sevoflurane. The skin of the surgical site was sterilized with an alcoholic antiseptic containing chlorhexidine before the operation. Several minutes after the start of operation, a fire occurred on using the electric cautery. Immediately, fire was extinguished by hands. The cover cloth is peeled off and it was confirmed that the burn extended from the right thoracic region to the buttocks. After cooling, it became a burn of II to III degrees. Operation was restarted, and at the end, the patient was allowed to breathe spontaneously for 5 minutes and extubated afterwards. The disinfectant with alcoholic content has a strong inflammability. It is necessary to dry it enough before using cautery.

AB  - A semi-empirical model for a steady linear fire front propagating\nthrough a statistically homogeneous porous bed, for the basic case of no\nwind, no slope, and fine fuel particles, is presented. The model\nstructure is modular, based on an open library of submodels for the\nrelevant phenomena. The submodeling of moisture heat absorption and\nradiation is addressed in detail. Presently, the model is not closed; it\nrequires two properties of the fire front as inputs. Various sensitivity\nanalyses and parametrical studies are performed. A laboratory test in a\nbed of pine needles showed that the model predictions are very sensitive\nto the flame height estimation and that the empirical submodels\navailable in the literature are not adequate. However, if the flame\nheight is considered an input, the rate of spread and the profile of the\nleading edge of the front in the fuel bed are predicted within the\nexperimental errors.

AB  - The construction of geographically precise, high-resolution time series of historical changes in land use is an important step in constructing more realistic models of bio- geophysical and bio-geochemical interactions with the atmosphere. However, such data are rarely available due to the typically imprecise nature of historical land use surveys and the relatively recent advent of sufficiently sensitive satellite remote sensing technology. In this article, we reconstruct and validate a geographically explicit historical database of land use in Amazonia for the period 1940–1995, at a 5¢· 5¢ spatial resolution, through a fusion of historical census data and a contemporary land use classification. The reconstruction indicates that the main changes in the land use occurred in the south and southeast regions of the Amazon in the states of Tocantins, Goia ´s, and Mato Grosso. These states were characterized by an intensification of planted pasture during the study period, accelerating after 1970, although in many areas planted pasture replaced natural pasture rather than natural vegetation because it was considered more productive for raising cattle. Croplands were observed to expand significantly in Goia ´s and Mato Grosso, but were almost absent in the state of Amazonas. More generally, within the study region land use change was greatest in regions of pioneer occupation in the Amazon and near the main roads such as the trans-Amazonian highway.

AB  - This paper assesses the efficacy and relevance of focus groups as participative tools for land use policy and planning. The use of focus groups has mushroomed in land use research and policy in response to new governance and empowerment agendas with their emphasis on using more deliberative and participative approaches. However, their use within social science research has been controversial given perceived methodological limitations of rigour and bias. A detailed critique of three recent research projects has been undertaken to assess focus group in theory and practice; rural diversification, public perception of landscape and visitor payback. The assessment considers key questions relating to inclusion, participation, empowerment, policy impact and understanding of complex policy issues. The results show that focus groups can perform multiple roles as exploratory, explanatory, participative and deliberative tools. Nevertheless, focus groups have important limitations and methodological protocols which demand more care and attention. Crucially, they should not be used in isolation to influence policy decisions; end user pressure for quick fixes, group dynamics, issues of representativeness, together with the biases of a facilitator, can easily mask, distort or misrepresent results. It is concluded that focus groups have significant potential as qualitative tools in landscape research but that they must be used carefully and in tandem with other techniques if their true potential is to be realised. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An approach is presented for approximating the expected spread rate of fires that burn across 2-dimensional landscapes with random fuel patterns. The method calculates a harmonic mean spread rate across a small 2-dimensional grid that allows the fire to move forward and laterally. Within this sample grid, all possible spatial fuel arrangements are enumerated and the spread rate of an elliptical fire moving through the cells is found by searching for the minimum travel time. More columns in the sample grid are required for accurately calculating expected spread rates where very slow-burning fuels are present, because the fire must be allowed to move farther laterally around slow patches. This calculation can be used to estimate fire spread rates across spatial fuel mixtures provided that the fire shape was determined from wind and slope. Results suggest that fire spread rates on random landscapes should increase with fire size and that random locations of fuel treatments would be inefficient in changing overall fire growth rates.</p>

AB  - An extensive set of wind-tunnel fires was burned to investigate convective heat transfer ahead of a steadily progressing fire front moving across a porous fuel bed. The effects of fuel and environmental variables on the gas temperature profile and the â€˜surface wind speedâ€™ (gas velocity at the fuel bed surface) are reported. In non-zero winds, the temperature of the air near the fuel bed surface decays exponentially with distance from the fire front. In zero winds, the temperature decreases rapidly within a very short distance of the flame front, then decays slowly thereafter. The maximum air temperature decreases as the free stream wind speed, packing ratio and fuel moisture content increase. The characteristic distance of the exponential decay increases strongly with the free stream wind speed and decreases with the packing ratio and surface area-to-volume ratio of the fuel. The surface wind speed depends strongly on the free stream wind speed, and to a lesser extent on packing ratio, fuel bed depth and fuel moisture content. There are three general regimes for the surface flow: (1) a constant velocity flow of approximately half the free stream flow, far from the flame front; (2) an intermediate zone of minimum flow characterised by low or reversed flow; and (3) a region near the flame front where the velocity rises rapidly almost to the free stream velocity. The boundaries between the three regions move further from the flame front with increasing wind speed, in a way which is only slightly affected by fuel geometry.

There are many case studies around the world of cities which demonstrate this process of reconnecting land use and transport.

AB  - Traditionally, forest fires in Mexico, the Caribe, and Central America have been perceived, by both urban and some rural societies and government agencies, only as destructive phenomena. Certainly 40% of forest fires originate from agricultural and pastoral practices. However, there are many native rural communities that make a refined use of fire, harmonizing food production and care for the environment. In the past couple of decades, however, a slight and gradual change in perspective has occurred, such that for fire managers, preserves managers, researchers, and non-government organizations, the fire ecology as well as the management of fire by rural communities have been incorporated into what is now referred to as "integral fire management." This term may be defined as the fusion of firefighting and prevention with the ecological use of fire and community fire management in order to preserve nature and to make the land productive. In initiating the implementation of integrated fire management, key roles have been played by national and regional governmental agencies, international and regional non-governmental agencies, as well as research universities and institutes.

After describing the context in which such courses exist, this article analyzes syllabi from fifteen courses in North American planning programs in two respects. The first examines the list of topics covered within each course by discussing the nature of primary, secondary, and peripheral topics. Second, the analysis uncovers the frequency with which specific readings are employed in each course.

AB  - Gordon Friend Science and Information Division Department of Conservation and Land Management P.O. Box 51, Wanneroo, W.A. 6065  Invertebrates are now recognised as critical elements in the maintenance of ecosystems, and many are seen to have potential as bio-indicators of environmental conditions. Information on their responses to environmental disturbance such as fire is therefore critical. There is a clear need to assess our current knowledge of invertebrate fire ecology, and examine the implications of the findings for fire management, nature conservation and future research.   An examination of data from two recent experimental studies, and a review of a broad cross-section of research carried out in temperate Australia over the past 40 years raises doubt that sound management decisions can be made from invertebrate fire ecology information collected to date. Invertebrate populations are so variable in time and space, being largely driven by environmental factors, that the impacts of fire may be largely over-ridden and almost impossible to predict. This is particularly the case where a broad level of taxonomic resolution is adopted. Furthermore, since post-fire succession may proceed to a new transient state also occupied by undisturbed communities, there is no 'ideal' stage or normal condition towards which management can aim.   In addition, considerable variability and shortcomings in experimental design and length of study exist. These deficiencies make it difficult to determine whether the outcomes observed are a true feature of invertebrate responses to fire, or are largely artefacts of the sampling procedure. Bearing this in mind, available data indicate a trend in invertebrate resilience to fire across broad habitat and climatic gradients. It is suggested that there is a need for conservatism in the application of high frequency and large scale fire regimes, particularly in the more mesic forested areas of Australia.   Given the variability and complexity of invertebrate assemblages and their responses to fire, a much more rigorous approach to methodology must be adopted if optimal fire regimes for invertebrate conservation in various habitat types are to be devised.  Most fire effects studies to date have focussed on single fire events, and many have contemporaneously sampled adjacent areas with different fire histories, making the assumption that any differences in the abundance or composition of the biota are attributable to fire. Such an assumption is rather tenuous, given the inherent within-site variability of plant and animal populations (Campbell & Tanton 1981). Furthermore, there has been an emphasis on fire effects in forest ecosystems, particularly on plants and mammals. Relatively few studies have examined semi-arid woodlands and shrublands, or concentrated on herpetofauna or invertebrates (see reviews by Suckling & Macfarlane 1984; Christensen & Abbott 1989; Friend 1993).

AB  - This paper presents a system dynamics approach to simultaneous land use/transportation system performance modeling. A model is designed based on the causality functions and feedback loop structure between a large number of physical, socioeconomic, and policy variables. The model system consists of 7 sub-models: population, migration of population, household, job growth-employment-land availability, housing development, travel demand, and traffic congestion level. The model is formulated in DYNAMO simulation language, and tested on a data set from Montgomery County, MD. In Part I: Methodology, the overall approach and the structure of the model system is discussed and the causal-loop diagrams and major equations are presented. In Part II: Application, the model is calibrated and tested with data from Montgomery County, MD. Least square method and overall system behavior are used to estimate the model parameters. The model is fitted with the 1970-80 data and validated with the 1980-1990 data. Robustness and sensitivities with respect to input parameters such as birth rate or regional economy growth are analyzed. The model performance as a policy analysis tool is also examined by predicting the year by year impacts of highway capacity expansion on land use and transportation system performance. While this is a first attempt in using dynamic system simulation modeling in simultaneous treatment of land use and transportation system interactions, and model development and application are limited to some extent due to data availability, the results clearly indicate that the proposed method is a promising approach in dealing with complex urban land use/transportation modeling.

AB  - Aspects of flammability of the major fuel arrays in a mallee shrubland community, and the basis for fire-spread in these discrete fuels, are examined and discussed. Relationships between plant size and weight of litter (shrubs and mallee eucalypts) or grass hummocks (Triodia irritans) were studied. Hummock mass was a function of hummock diameter and height. On ignition, maximum flame length was related to hummock height and diameter. For mallee eucalypts the mass of litter beneath individual plants was related to the diameter of the litter bed. Flame length was also related to litter bed diameter. In other species of shrubs, fires were not sustained independently. We hypothesize that T. irritans will play a major role in fire spread in communities because flames from hummocks will have the greatest ability to bridge gaps between fuel arrays (flames longer than in eucalypts). Size of hummocks will have an important bearing on propagation of fire across fuel-gaps. By contrast, the main role of eucalypts in fire-spread may be as a source of burning brands which initiate spot fires. There is scope to understand fire-spread in these communities on the basis of flame lengths (in conjunction with plant size) in relation to wind.

Although one\ncannot speak of a land "market" in the strict sense of the word,\nthere is an urban land allocation system in which land lease rights\ncan be acquired through the payment of a land-use fee. If the urban\nland market is to develop in a sustainable manner, new credible institutions\nneed to be established that can safeguard greater legal security\nand transparency. For these purposes, it is necessary to establish\na management system that can support the legal (tenure security),\neconomic (leases, taxes) and broader aspects (spatial and environmental\nland use policies) of land administration. To make an urban land\nadministration system socially credible and functional, land-related\ninformation should be registered and structured at a detailed spatial\nlevel, such as parcels. There is no parcel-based information system\nin China, but the country has developed a population registration\nsystem at a detailed spatial level that could be a starting point\nto develop integrated information systems, or a so-called "local\nspatial data infrastructure".

AB  - Old-growth forests are biologically and ecologically valuable systems that are disappearing worldwide at a rapid rate. Me ´xico still holds large areas covered by temperate forests in themountains of the Sierra Madre Occidental, but few of these retain old-growth characteristics. We studied four sites with remnant old-growth forests in Mesa de las Guacamayas, a site in the Sierra Madre Occidental in northwestern Chihuahua, to assess their composition, structure, and age characteristics. Overstory tree densities and basal areas at each sitewere based onmeasurements of all trees .1.3mtall. The overstory was dominated by large Pinus durangensis, P. strobiformis,and Pseudotsuga menziesii (270–335 trees ha1, basal area 24–42m2 ha1), with a subcanopy formed mostly of oaks. This species composition, combined with the lack of vertical structural development, and thus of fuel ladders, suggests that these forests are relatively resistant to severe wildfire. We evaluated forest attributes in the context of local fire regimes and regional climatic patterns, and found that frequent disturbance by surface fires has been part of the study sites’ histories for at least 250 years. While climatewas a driver of fire regimes historically in thismountain range, humans appear to have played a role in interruptions of the fire regime in the second half of the 20th century. Age distributions showed recruitment to the canopy over ;250 years, while fires in the four sites recurred every 6–12 years. Temporary interruption of the fire regime in the mid-20th century at three sites was associated with increased tree establishment, especially by broadleaved species. One site had an uninterrupted fire regime and showed continuous tree establishment, consistent with the self-reinforcing role of frequent fire in regulating live and dead fuel loads. Remnant old-growth forests such as those we sampled are becoming increasingly rare in the SierraMadre Occidental. The biodiversity and ecological processes that they support are highly threatened and their conservation must be made a priority in the U.S.-Me ´xico borderlands.

AB  - Using embodied HANPP to analyze teleconnections in the global land system: Conceptual considerations In our rapidly globalizing world economy activities in one region have increasingly important effects on ecological, economic or social processes elsewhere, an effect which we here denote as ‘teleconnections’ between different regions. Biomass trade, one of the causes behind such teleconnections, is currently growing exponentially. Integrated analyses of changes in the global land system are high on the agenda of sustainability science, but a methodological framework for a consistent allocation of environmental burdens related to the consumption and production of biomass between regions has not been put forth to date. The concept of the ‘embodied human appropriation of net primary production’ (abbreviated ‘embodied HANPP’ or ‘eHANPP’) allows for the assessment of the ‘upstream’ effects on ecosystem energetics associated with a particular level of biomass consumption or with a given biomass-based product. This concept is based on HANPP and its two components: (1) productivity changes resulting from land conversion (?NPPLC), and (2) harvest of biomass in ecosystems (NPPh). HANPP, defined as the sum of ?NPPLC and NPPh in any given territory, is indicative of the intensity with which humans use the land for their purposes. eHANPP is defined as the NPP appropriated in the course of biomass production, encompassing losses along the production chain as well as productivity changes induced through land conversion or harvest. By making the pressure exerted on ecosystems associated with imports and exports visible, eHANPP allows for the analysis of teleconnections between producing and consuming regions. This article puts forward the eHANPP concept, illustrates its utility for integrated socioecological landchange research based on top-down data on global HANPP and biomass consumption, and discusses the possibilities and challenges related to its quantification in bottom-up approaches.

AB  - Oregon's landmark land use planning system has been criticized for imposing large negative effects on landowners' property values, although evidence to support these claims has been lacking. This paper examines longitudinal data for undeveloped parcels since before adoption of the planning system. The sample includes parcels under different land use regulations, and it compares Oregon to Washington. The results indicate generally that property values have increased at similar rates both inside and outside urban growth boundaries, and across parcels zoned for different uses and across state lines. The results are consistent both with theory and with other studies indicating land use regulations can have positive, neutral or negative effects. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The fire-spreading phenomenon is highly complex, and existing mathematical models of fire are so complex themselves that any possibility of analytical solution is precluded. Instead, there has been some success when studying fire spread by means of simulation. However, precise and reliable mathematical models are still under development. They require extensive computing resources, being adequate to run in batch mode but making it difficult to meet real-time deadlines. As fire scientists need to learn about the problem domain through experimentation, simulation software needs to be easily modified. The authors used different discrete event modeling techniques to deal with these problems. They have qualitatively compared the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) and Cell-DEVS simulation results against controlled laboratory experiments, which allowed them to validate both simulation models of fire spread. They were able to show how these techniques can improve the definition of fire models

AB  - A growing number of researchers and policy-makers now see the recognition and formalisation of local or customary land rights as a means of tackling insecurity of land tenure and encouraging investment. Several tools, such as the Rural Land Plans (PFRs) used in Benin, seem to resolve the tension between the logic of registering rights in order to increase productivity and the logic of securing complex local rights and reducing conflict. However, taking account of complex customary land rights raises strategic and methodological questions, and calls for closer examination of the purpose of operations to register rights. While PFRs are potentially a good tool for dealing with complexity, current policy debate in Benin tends to focus on them as a tool for privatisation. But given the diversity of local situations and complexity of land rights, a single model of private property will inevitably engender exclusion and conflict, for questionable economic benefits. We can think that what is needed is a pluralist vision, and rights registration procedures that build sustainable links between diverse and evolving local modes of land regulation and a pluralist public framework.

AB  - The Missionary Ridge Fire (summer 2002) burned approximately 28 520 ha in the San Juan Basin, Colorado. Prior to the fire, no native Colorado River cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki pleuriticus) had been observed in the San Juan Basin for over 100 yr due to over-fishing, introduction of non-native fishes, and habitat alteration. Mud and ash flows into the Florida River in fall 2002 and spring 2003 resulted in a complete fish kill of non-native rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brown trout (Salmo trutta). Between 2003 and 2007, the Colorado Division of Wildlife released 138 728 Colorado River cutthroat trout ranging from 5 cm to 35 cm in length within a 22.5 km reach of the Florida River. Two barriers, a reservoir dam and an irrigation diversion dam, prevented non-native fish from entering this reach. Each fall from 2003 through 2007, we surveyed two locations on the Florida River and estimated population size. Heavy silt deposits and extremely high river flows (3.8 m3 s-1) precluded us from making population estimates during 2003 to 2005. The catch of Colorado River cutthroat trout decreased from 76% in 2006 to only 44% in 2007. Interspecific competition and predation by rainbow and brown trout, whirling disease (Myxobolus cerebralis), and extreme fluctuations in regulated river flows in 2007 may have contributed to the observed decline in cutthroat trout. It is still too early to conclude whether reintroduction efforts of Colorado River cutthroat trout have been successful, but early indications suggest non-native trout are beginning to re-colonize this section of the Florida River at the expense of the cutthroat trout.

AB  - This paper reviews the relationships between land use and climate change. It explores how land use decisions will be affected by future changes in the climate, but also the feedbacks from land use change to the global climate system through greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. Past changes in land use were characterised by decreasing areas of agricultural use and increasing areas of forested and urbanised land. This has led to UK land use being a net sink for GHGs, mostly due to forestation. However, existing forests have on average passed their age for maximum net removals of carbon from the atmosphere. In the next decade at least, net removals from UK forests are likely to decrease significantly. Longer term scenarios of future land use change are consistent in their expectation of further declines in the agricultural area used for food production – offset to some extent by increased bioenergy cropping – along with increases in forested and urban areas. These trends are broadly consistent with the observed past land use change, but are calculated from various assumptions about future changes in drivers rather than by extrapolation from the past. Socio-economic and technological changes are likely to be the most important drivers for land use, with climate change having a smaller influence. The land use changes represented in these scenarios would likely reduce GHG emissions and enhance carbon sinks. These trends would be reinforced by small future changes in the climate, but large climatic changes are likely to cause net GHG fluxes to switch from being a sink to a source. Land use change will also be moderated by potential policy goals that seek to reduce GHG emissions from land and/or increase the size of land-based sinks. This includes strategies to reduce carbon and nitrogen emissions through increased efficiency, afforestation and biofuel production.

Oven-dry moisture content of fine fuels (< 6.25 mm diameter) ranged from 30% to 105%. Forty-nine of 90 fires successfully propagated the length (2.0 m) of the elevated fuel bed. A logistic model to predict the probability of successful fire spread was developed using stepwise logistic regression. The variables selected to predict propagation were wind speed, slope percent, moisture content, fuel loading, and relative humidity.

AB  - In land administration (LA), the right to exercising property/ownership rights on land is based on cadastral processes of adjudication, survey and rights registration. Private ownership rights are now being taken up in pastoral areas, where they must contend with pastoralists' land rights. Pastoral land use requires seasonal migrations determined by climatic conditions. This study aimed to find out how well the existing land laws and property rights in LA are able to serve the requirements of pastoralists land use, identify mismatches and put forward possible solutions. A case study was carried out in the Samburu-Laikipia-Isiolo-Meru landscape in Kenya. Data on the degree of livestock dependency among pastoralist communities, the spatial extent and patterns of dry season migrations, the resulting encounters between herders' and non-pastoralist land use actors, and the perceptions of land rights held by actors were collected through a variety of methods and analysed. The results show that pastoralism is still active. The migration corridors reveal that herders maintain extensive dry season mobility, even though some of the corridors currently overlap with areas where land is privately owned by non-pastoralist land use actors. Moreover, the results show that most non-pastoralist land use actors have their land rights registered, but seasonal encounters with migrating pastoralists persist as pastoralists continue to exercise customary rights of communal use. We conclude that existing land laws and property rights in LA are suitable for sedentary land use, but do not address how to serve pastoralists land rights in time and space. The pastoralist's migration routes and patterns obtained indicated that it is possible to predict where pastoralists will be at a given time/drought period. This information could be used by decision makers and land administrators to identify where and when pastoralists' land rights apply. This could provide the foundation for including pastoralists' spatiotemporal land rights in LA. Arguments emphasize that adjudication, surveys and registration of rights should focus not only on ownership and full control of land, but also on defined periods when spatiotemporal mobility and access rights could be granted to pastoralists. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, a methodology to perform the acoustic characterization of a forest fire event is reported. A review of the influence of fuel type (litter, grass, shrubs, slash), fuel moisture, and weather factors on fire behaviour and on the relative acoustic spectrum has been carried out. Fire produced noise is basically due to periodic fluctuations of whirling structures at the fire's basis; these structures have natural low frequencies and are inversely proportional to fuel surface. The analysis of fire emission properties has been based upon laboratory and field testing, consisted of the burning of different fuels placed on tables or on field plots. The objectives of the trials have been the evaluation of fire acoustic spectra, with respect to the different fuel types and fire conditions. The frequency content of the acoustic signals has been evaluated; the results obtained have confirmed the main spectrum features reported in literature. Tests have also been made to evaluate the fire radiated heat to fibre optic sensors with cables in open air, buried or inside the flames, in order to characterise sensors behaviour with respect to fire, wind and smoke. The results of the tests have been used in the design phase of a new fire monitoring system made up of acoustic sensors, which is able to detect and track fires from the beginning, and fibre optic sensors, for a capillary monitoring of temperature in forest areas.

AB  - Controlling wildfires within the wildland/urban interface has proven to be the most complex challenge facing wildland fire agencies. Although program improvements to increase the efficiency of interface suppression efforts have been suggested, the availability of information about the wildfire environment remains a critical resource for wildland fire planning. Geographic Information Systems (GISs) can provide the technology to store, manipulate, analyze, and display spatially oriented information in a form necessary for efficient fire planning and incident decision making. Complex map and attribute information, including vegetation types, fuels models, weather patterns, topography, fire suppression environment, landuse characteristics, and microenvironmental features, can be rapidly summarized and integrated. This integrated information can be used to create unique polygons useful in predicting fire behavior, allocating fire suppression resources, and as an aid in planning land use. Simplified user interfaces and the portability of new hardware systems will allow GISs to be used at every level of wildland fire planning. © 1989 National Fire Protection Association.

A method for the determination of the coefficients in this model based on the dynamic features of a spreading fire is given. The numerical study of the mathematical problem proposed allows us to predict the rate of spread, the fire front perimeter and the temperature distribution for line-ignition and point-ignition fires. These results are compared with success to experimental data. Furthermore, the model allows us to estimate the acceleration of spread for a point-ignition fire in its initial stage and in the steady-state phase.

AB  - Predicting fire spread rates is essential in planning and deciding whether to conduct prescribed fires or suppressing forest fires. This study was conducted with the objective of developing a fire spread model for deciduous forest fires by using a simple statistical model. Test fires were conducted under a range of weather and fuel conditions to gather quantitative data on fire spreading. A series of 80 experimental fire plots were set in deciduous forests in the Northern Thailand during the forest fire seasons from 2008-2009. The factors influencing the fire spread rate, i.e., weather, fuel, and topography conditions, were measured to model the fire spread. According to the burning experiments, the fire spread rate was 0.51-2.55 m/min. Multiple nonlinear regression analyses of slope terrain, fuel load, and moisture content of fuels were found to be able to accurately predict the fire spread rate at a confidence level of 25-88%. The developed model can be applied to deciduous forest fuels in other regions of Thailand. However, its use should be restricted to typical weather conditions.

The use of fire has shaped landscape patterns that have high ecological and cultural diversity, e.g. heathlands, open grasslands, meadows, and swidden (shifting) agriculture sites. In the Nordic co untries and Scotland historic natural fires caused by lightning and human - made fires have also significantly influenced the composition and structure of forest ecosystems. The rapid socio- economic changes in the post - World War II Europe led also to a change of land - use systems and landscape patterns, resulting in elimination of traditional burning practises. Due to new air quality standards and a generally prevailing opinion that fire would damage ecosystem stability and biodiversity, government administrations imposed fire bans in most European countries. During the second half of the 20 th century traditional fire use in land management survived in a few places only, such as in heathland management in the United Kingdom or in Finland’s forestry. In the 1970s it became increasingly evident that the abandonment of traditional land - use methods resulted in the elimination of the disturbance events that shaped many valuable landscape types and ecosystems. Changing paradigms in ecology and nature conservation are leading to the reconsideration of fire- exclusion policies in certain land management sectors, including: nature conservation, hunting, forestry and landscape management. A number of prescribed burning research projects throughout Western and Baltic Europe and a revival of traditional burning practices indicate a restoration of the functional role of fire in the management of ecosystems and landscapes. The paper provides a variety of case studies from Scotland, Germany, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries and the ongoing process of intra - regional co- operation in the frame of the European Fire in Nature Conservation Network.

AB  - A one-dimensional model of fire spread through a nonhomogeneous fuel is developed. The fuel is modelled as a spatial Markov chain. Spatial dependence of fuel type, and lag times when crossing fuel boundaries, are both allowed. Formulae for the average rate of spread and for the variance in rate of spread are derived. Numerical examples of fire spread in sagebrush and grass fuels are developed.

AB  - With the publication of the Sydney Area Transportation Study, land-use/trans- portation studies now have been conducted in all capital cities as well as in the majority of other urban areas with populations in excess of 40.000. A review of these studies is made and a qualitative assessment is attempted of the technical phases land-use planning, trip-generation, trip-distribution, modal-split, traffic assignment and evaluation. Full summary results of this comparative survey are presented in tabular form, although themes developed in the text are illustrated with specific examples from individual studies. The methodology of land-use/transportation studies has been attacked by some Australian writers. An attempt is made to assess the relevance of these criticisms when applied to the practical planning process in Australia.

AB  - Current wildfire management policy succeeds in suppressing 99% of all fires on pub- lic lands. Indirect costs of this achievement include the development of dense veg- etation in the absence of fire, and increasingly more intense fires when they do erupt. The result is a fire management system with rising costs and fire-dependent forests that are frequently characterized by declining health. Wildland fire use (WFU), the use of fire to accomplish specific pre-stated resource management objectives, is considered appropriate in many remote wildlands where a naturally ignited fire may safely be used to improve forest health. Ecological benefits associa- ted with WFU include improved watershed conditions, enhanced wildlife habitat, and more resilient forested ecosystems. Economic benefits include reduced suppression and fuels treatment costs over the long term. Policy challenges are complex, how- ever; land management agencies face increased planning requirements as well as the need to develop both institutional and public support before the full potential of wildland fire use can be realized.

AB  - CLand consumption due to residential development, economic growth and transportation belongs to the most serious environmental pressures on landscapes worldwide, in particular in urbanised areas. Accordingly, the aim of containing the development of land is rated increasingly high on the agenda of environmental policy, at least in densely populated countries such as Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands or the UK. As a result, different strategies and instruments to prevent excessive land consumption are being discussed. However, many of these strategies and instruments adopt a rather general approach, while it seems more effective to define the particular areas where the goal of reducing land consumption is to be pursued. Such an approach must draw on information about how detrimental specific land use transitions are with regard to, for instance, the functionality of soils, water balance or habitat quality at specific locations. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for the impact assessment of land use transition in urban areas which highlights how such information can be acquired. This framework includes the differentiation of two levels of impact assessment

AB  - The integrated structure/control design of flexible robot arms is
presented. The open loop, poles, and zeros are relocated by modifying
the geometry and the structure of the arm. To determine the geometry and
structure in a systematic manner, an inverse mapping method based on
finite-element modeling and sensitivity analysis is applied to the
flexible arm design. Using this method, a beam geometry that allows for
a significantly high natural frequency is obtained. In order to relocate
zeros, the torque transmission technique is applied. It makes it
possible to remove nonminimum-phase zeros and make the endpoint control
robustly stable. Based on the theoretical analysis and computation, a
prototype arm was designed and built, and its performance was evaluated

AB  - The global land community has accepted that individual land titling on its own cannot deliver security of tenure in a complete or timely fashion, and that a continuum of land rights approach needs to be used. This approach needs to be accompanied by new and innovative pro-poor forms of land recordation to cater for these new forms of tenure. The proposed design draws on conventional land administration systems and the experiences of professionals, civil society and researchers regarding the land tenure systems of the poor and how they work in customary, informal, and post crisis areas. It is based on eight general design requirements, including delivery of preventive justice and co-management arrangements. The design is made up of ten interlinked elements, with an emphasis on a continuum of land recording. The design is only a first step toward a coherent robust framework. Some first experiences are reported, however, further suggested work includes: dissemination and awareness raising; further piloting; incorporation of institutional and political economy analysis; tailoring methods of implementation; and investigating approaches for funding, training, and material resources. Ultimately the pro-poor land recordation system should bring tenure security to the poor at faster rates and lower costs, and should thus enable a foothold on the lower rungs of the property ladder. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

While the emphasis here is on temporal changes, it is being realised increasingly that the study of temporal changes cannot be divorced from a consideration of spatial changes. This study deals with:(i) assessing measures of biodiversity in relation to time since fire (ii)collating all the relevant Australian literature on changes in plant species composition with time since fire, (iii) identifying species' environmental and vegetation characteristics that might help explain the changes observed in vascular plant diversity and (iv) seeking national patterns in diversity changes

AB  - Drawing on recent work in environmental economics, this paper introduces the concept of the land use intensity of economic activity, analogous to the more familiar materials and energy intensities. It then considers how this might be measured, looking at a range of economic and land use change statistics, and how it might be reduced. Environmental compensation is seen as a possible means of achieving the latter objective. It is argued that no single measure of land use Intensity would be meaningful, because concern about [`]lost land' Is typically not about land in terms of hectares or economic value, but about the environmental significance of land use change. This in turn reflects a variety of material, post-material and non-instrumental values. The paper concludes that composite measures of the land use intensity of economic activity are likely to be the most useful; that environmental compensation may be a useful policy instrument within a carefully formulated framework; and that differences in values have to be confronted if sustainable land use change is ever to be defined.

AB  - The bacterial type IV pilus (T4P) is the strongest biological motor known to date as its retraction can generate forces well over 100 pN. Myxococcus xanthus, a δ-proteobacterium, provides a good model for T4P investigations because its social (S) gliding motility is powered by T4P. In this study, the interactions among M. xanthus T4P proteins were investigated using genetics and the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system. Our genetic analysis suggests that there is an integrated T4P structure that crosses the inner membrane (IM), periplasm and the outer membrane (OM). Moreover, this structure exists in the absence of the pilus filament. A systematic Y2H survey provided evidence for direct interactions among IM and OM proteins exposed to the periplasm. For example, the IM lipoprotein PilP interacted with its cognate OM protein PilQ. In addition, interactions among T4P proteins from the thermophile Thermus thermophilus were investigated by Y2H. The results indicated similar protein-protein interactions in the T4P system of this non-proteobacterium despite significant sequence divergence between T4P proteins in T. thermophilus and M. xanthus. The observations here support the model of an integrated T4P structure in the absence of a pilus in diverse bacterial species.

AB  - Anthropogenic fires dominate Africa, where they have long shaped landscapes and livelihoods. Humans evolved in Africa's fire-prone grasslands and savannas, eventually taking ignition into their own hands. This chapter reviews current knowledge about and concerns over fire in two African countries, Mali and Madagascar. Vast areas of land burn in both countries each year as people light fires to shape vegetation communities for a number of often overlapping and sometimes competing reasons, ranging from pasture and game management, to crop field preparation, to pest and wildfire control. In Mali, hunting and agropastoral fires shape vegetation zones along the gradient between the dry north and the more humid south. Their anthropogenic nature removes much of the interannual variation common in fire regimes elsewhere-they are a regular, predictable feature of the landscape. In Madagascar, fires prepare and maintain the vast pastures of the interior, and enable farmers to cultivate farther into the few remaining stands of forest. Although rural populations rely upon fire for numerous livelihood activities, they sometimes struggle to control fire. Policy makers have long criticized the fires for reducing tree cover and contributing to land degradation, raising the specter of desertification in Mali and deforestation in Madagascar. As a result, colonial and independent governments have periodically tried to eradicate-or at least minimize-landscape burning. These efforts wax and wane with the political context, with drought cycles, and with periods of international concern. Government fire restrictions are frequently perceived by rural residents as an imposition on their way of life, and enforcement has led to animosity against government agents. Given people's resistance, as well as fire's inevitability in wet-dry grassy landscapes, fire management is largely at a standstill. Some form of co-management is likely the only viable solution, yet in order for this to work, governments will have to accept the usefulness and inevitability of many fires.

AB  - A recursive experimental design method for simultaneously optimizing both mechanical structure and control is presented in this paper. Control gains are optimally tuned for a given prototype of mechatronic system, and its mechanical structure is physically modified so that control performance can be further improved. The entire control tuning, evaluation, and structure alteration process is repeated until the desired performance goals are achieved. In each iteration, incremental design changes are determined based on a sensitivity Jacobian relating structural changes to performance improvements. The sensitivity Jacobian is updated during the recursive process using the actual data of the design changes. To estimate the Jacobian despite few data points, a pseudoinverse method and a parameter perturbation algorithm, termed singular-value excitation, are developed. The mechanical structure is modified recursively and quickly by using structure reinforcement and rapid prototyping techniques. The feasibility of mechanical structure changes is taken into account in determining the design changes. The proposed methodology is verified through simulation and applied to the design of a robot positioning system. The robot arm structure is modified with regard to stiffness and damping by using steel reinforced epoxy. PD control gains are optimized every time the structure is modified. Through the recursive procedure, an optimal combination of the arm structure and control gains is obtained.

AB  - Prescribed burn regimes for protected areas in southern Africa are often based solely on modeling of historic data and onsite experimentation. Most rural communities in this region continue to rely on fire to manage natural resources for subsistence needs, yet relatively few detailed studies of local fire knowledge and practices exist. The long history of anthropogenic fire in southern Africa suggests that traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of fire could provide further insight into location-specific anthropogenic contributions to fire-savanna interactions. This study used an ethnographic approach to investigate how local people think about and manage fire as part of their daily activities in two rural communities in southern Mozambique. Residents use fire for a range of livelihood activities and identify both controlled and uncontrolled anthropogenic fire sources. Fire regimes are presented for five common livelihood activities including frequency, seasonality, area, and type of habitat burned. Comparisons between historic and contemporary fires revealed decreases in the number of controlled burns and consequent increases in the size and number of wildfires, but no changes in the purposes for conducting controlled burns or the methods people used to conduct burns. Community fire regulations aim to reduce personal and communal property destruction, as well as protect locally valuable biodiversity. The results highlight the importance in accessing indigenous fire TEK for understanding anthropogenic contributions to fire regimes. Furthermore, they demonstrate that despite different worldviews, indigenous and western fire experts share a common goal in maintaining regional biodiversity.

AB  - Fire prevention and fire management require knowledge and evaluation of the combined effects of different factors affecting the fire environment. In the absence of extreme fire behavior (torching, spotting, crowning, and fire whirls), the effect of fire environment on fire spread and behavior can be adequately simulated using different models, mainly based on semi-physical approaches. In addition, the effects on fire behavior can be integrated at various scales using spatially and temporally explicit fire spread and behavior simulators, e.g. the FARSITE fire area simulator. Criticisms of fire simulators frequently concern the need of high resolution environmental data, in particular data of environmental variables that quickly change in space and time, e.g. the wind speed and direction. Consequently, drawbacks arise when we attempt to evaluate the regional and local impact of the expected climatic changes on fire behavior and fire severity. Applications of downscaling techniques are needed to generate probability distributions of wind speed and directions. The aim of this work is (1) to evaluate the accuracy of wind field maps obtained by dynamical downscaling of a global climate model, (2) to compare the wind field maps with wind data obtained by computational fluid dynamics models, and (3) to analyze the sensitivity of fire simulators to the inaccuracy of wind data. The results show differences in fire spread and fire severity when different approaches are used. The study also showed the capabilities of wind field maps from computational fluid dynamic models to evaluate the potential impact of climate changes on fire behavior and risk in Mediterranean areas.

AB  - The management of fire in savannas has been informed by a strong tradition of fire experiments, especially in Africa. This research tradition is much shorter in the 2 million square kilometres of tropical savannas in northern Australia, but has yielded several natural experiments, and three designed, manipulative, controlled field experiments (hereafter &#39;manipulative&#39; experiments) of international significance (at Munmarlary, Kapalga and Kidman Springs in the Northern Territory). Here we assess the contributions of experiments, in particular the manipulative experiments, to ecological understanding and biodiversity management in Australia&#39;s savannas. Running from 1973 to 1996, the Munmarlary experiment comprised hectare-scale experimental plots with four replicated dry season fire treatments, and was designed to examine interactions between fire, landscape and biodiversity. The Kapalga experiment ran from 1989 to 1995, with a range of fire treatments broadly similar to those at Munmarlary. However, experimental units were 10&#8211;20 km<sup>2</sup> sub-catchments, making it one of the largest, replicated fire experiments ever conducted. The Kidman Springs experiment focused on grass-layer productivity and composition to meet the needs of the pastoral industry, but also provided an opportunity to examine biodiversity responses to different fire regimes. Methodologically, the experiments have generally focused on phenomena&#8212;the responses to different fire treatments of individual taxa&#8212;rather than on mechanisms that determine response syndromes. They have highlighted that a range of responses to differences in fire regime is possible, and that no single fire regime can optimise all biodiversity outcomes. For effective conservation of biodiversity in the face of such complexity, conservation goals will need to be made explicit. The existing portfolio of manipulative experiments is incomplete, lacking especially a consideration of some critical savanna taxa and environments, and providing little information on the significance of spatial and temporal variability in fire patterns, especially at small scales. An understanding of fire in Australian savanna landscapes remains inadequate, so there is a continuing need for close partnerships between scientists and conservation managers, with fire management treated as a series of landscape experiments in an adaptive management framework.

AB  - The wild population of the palm Ptychosperma macarthurii near Darwin, in monsoonal northern Australia, is regionally endangered and provides a focus to illustrate a range of issues pertinent to conservation of rainforest habitat. Surveys in 1990 found that several populations exhibited a polarised size class structure typified by large adults and small juvenile plants. Over the following decade, in the absence of wildfire and in a period of reduced disturbance from introduced buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), cattle (Bos indicus) and pig (Sus scrofa), sufficient small juvenile plants survived and grew so as to infill the intermediate size classes. Three stage (bifid, juvenile and adult) transition matrix models characterised the population as declining under all observed conditions (intrinsic rate of increase: unburnt + few animals 0.9850; unburnt + many animals 0.9584; burnt <1 year 0.8737; burnt 1-2 years 0.9146; burnt >2 years 0.9937). In the absence of fire, simulations conducted to explore management options revealed a positive rate of increase with exclusion of introduced animals. With only partial introduced animal control or supplementation with juvenile plants, the median rate of increase remained negative. The regional population is at risk by more frequent and more intense fire due to the invasion of exotic grass species and land use changes in the catchment which result in an increased drying of the rainforest habitat. Ongoing decline is the most likely outcome in the absence of effective management intervention. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In fire safety engineering terms it is necessary to ensure that available safe escape time (ASET) is greater than required safe escape time (RSET) by an acceptable margin of safety. ASET depends upon the time–concentration curves for smoke, irritant and asphxyiant gases and heat and the effects of their concentrations or accumulating doses on occupant escape capability, and in particular time to incapacitation. Smoke and irritant gases also influence RSET, by affecting behaviour and movement speeds of escaping occupants. This chapter presents the full suite of fractional effective concentration and fractional effective dose expressions developed in Chapters 3 and 4, and describes how they are used in combination and applied to time–concentration fire data obtained from full-scale fire experiments or computational fire dynamics models, in order to calculate time to escape impairment, incapacitation and lethality. A worked example of application to actual fire data is presented. The application of the method to fire safety engineering design and forensic fire investigation is discussed, with guidance on consideration of uncertainties and variations in human susceptibility.

AB  -  How should problem-solving representations for complex knowledge domains be designed? Traditional approaches typically address the problem of semantic complexity by designing systems that offer multiple and often heterogonous forms of representation. The REEP approach advocates structure preserving integration of the different classes and perspectives of a domain within a single representation. This work reports on a novel representational system for nurse rostering that was designed under the REEP approach. An empirical evaluation suggests the kinds of knowledge support provided by the representation and demonstrates that participants prefer fully integrated over selective views of information even though the former increases visual complexity. This knowledge support is explained in terms of more abstract domain independent cognitive benefits that we present as reasons for adopting the REEP approach.

AB  - In fire safety engineering terms it is necessary to ensure that available safe escape time (ASET) is greater than required safe escape time (RSET) by an acceptable margin of safety. ASET depends upon the time–concentration curves for smoke, irritant and asphxyiant gases and heat and the effects of their concentrations or accumulating doses on occupant escape capability, and in particular time to incapacitation. Smoke and irritant gases also influence RSET, by affecting behaviour and movement speeds of escaping occupants. This chapter presents the full suite of fractional effective concentration and fractional effective dose expressions developed in Chapters 3 and 4, and describes how they are used in combination and applied to time–concentration fire data obtained from full-scale fire experiments or computational fire dynamics models, in order to calculate time to escape impairment, incapacitation and lethality. A worked example of application to actual fire data is presented. The application of the method to fire safety engineering design and forensic fire investigation is discussed, with guidance on consideration of uncertainties and variations in human susceptibility.

AB  - Spatial and temporal patterns of fire history are affected by factors such as topography, vegetation, and climate. It is unclear, however, how these factors influenced fire history patterns in small isolated forests, such as that found on Rincon Peak, a "sky island" mountain range in southern Arizona, USA. We reconstructed the fire history of Rincon Peak to evaluate the influences of broad-scale (i.e., climate) versus local-scale (i.e., topographic) factors on fire occurrence and extent. We evaluated both fire scars and tree demography (natality and mortality) to investigate surface fire and crown fire events. The fire history of a 310 ha study area surrounding the top of Rincon Peak was reconstructed by tree-ring sampling in 21 plots. Between 1648 and 1763, spreading fires on Rincon Peak were controlled primarily by regional climate. Widespread surface fires occurred during drought years, and were generally synchronized with regional fire events known from an extensive network of other fire history studies. After 1763, fire extent was apparently limited by local factors (i.e., fuels) as frequent fires continued to burn, but were limited to the southern part of the study area until a widespread fire occurred in 1819. Landscape fires (i.e., fires that scarred â‰¥2 plots) were absent from the entire study area between 1819 and 1867 despite continued burning in adjacent mountain ranges. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the 1867 fire was both a surface and a stand-replacing event that killed most trees within a 60 ha patch. Our findings suggest that past climatic variations had important effects on fire regimes and age structures of small, fragmented ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) landscapes like Rincon Peak. Given anticipated climate changes, the rich biodiversity harbored in these steep, isolated landscapes will be critical habitat in the migration of species and should therefore be considered high conservation priority.

AB  - UK government assistance to Nepal by a rural development programme in the Koshi Hills - a heavily populated area of predominantly susbistence farmers and with a wide range of climatic conditions. Following a programme of basic surveys and studies, together with a few small development projects between 1977 and 1979, a multi-sectoral protramme was implemented between 1980 and 1985. The objective was to strengthen local services, particularly in the natural resources field, and included land use (crops, livestock, community forestry), roads, bridges and trails, drinking water supply schemes, irrigation projects, cottage industries, agricultural education, in-service teacher training, health and women's development. Reviews the experience gained in implementing the sectoral projects.-from Author

AB  - This review explores the role of land use and land use change as a determinant of the soil's ability to sequester and store carbon in the UK. Over 95 percent of the UK land carbon stock is located in soils which are subjected to a range of land uses and global changes. Land use change can result in rapid soil loss of carbon from peatlands, grasslands, plantation forest and native woodland. Soil carbon accumulates more slowly (decadal) but gains can be made when croplands are converted to grasslands, plantation forest or native woodland. The need for land for food production and renewable forms of energy could have considerable influence on UK soil carbon storage in the future. There is a need to recognise the risk of soil carbon losses occurring when land use change to increase carbon storage is offset by compensatory land use conversions elsewhere that result in net carbon release. The protection of peatland and other organic soil carbon stocks, and the management of cropland, grassland and forest soils to increase carbon sequestration, will be crucial to the maintenance of the UK carbon balance. It will be necessary to develop policy to balance trade-offs between soil carbon gains with other land use priorities. These include the sustainable production of food, bio-energy and fibre crops and livestock, water quality and hydrology, greenhouse gas emission control and waste management, all of which are underpinned by the soil.

AB  - Land use/cover change (LUCC) is one of the most concerned environmental problems by scientists, land managers and policy makers. LUCC can affect energy flow, biogeochemical and hydrological cycling in terrestrial ecosystems through altering land surface and species composition. Ecosystem carbon cycling responds differently to various LUCC types, showing a pattern of CO2 release into the atmosphere when LUCC from a high-biomass forest to low-biomass grassland, cropland or urban area. Previous reports indicated that global terrestrial ecosystem released 2.21 Pg C (1 Pg C=1015 g C) per year induced by LUCC during the 1990s, which explains about 25% of the global C emission per year in the same period; and in the last two centuries, the released C from LUCC accounts for 50% of the C emission from fossil fuel combustion. The LUCC patterns are totally diversified for regions around the world, which cause obviously different C fluxes among them. The reports showed that LUCC in the tropics is a C source, while it is a C sink in the middle and high latitude regions in the northern hemisphere, which possibly explain a large part of the "missing carbon sink" in the terrestrial ecosystems. Currently, modelling is the most popular way to simulate LUCC-induced changes in ecosystem C cycling. The quantitative relationship between LUCC patterns and their related processes and ecosystem carbon cycling remains uncertain. This uncertainty causes great discrepancies in the estimation of terrestrial ecosystem CO2 fluxes from land use/cover changes. In the near future, except for carrying on long-term experiments to determine these quantitative relationships, model development by integrating LUCC with vegetation dynamic model and ecosystem process model will be essential for making an accurate estimation of C fluxes induced by LUCC. Sound land management can greatly increase C storage in the terrestrial ecosystems during LUCC processes. However, the quantification of land management effects is not well-established yet and land management is thus not included in most simulation models of LUCC impacts, which needs more researches in the future.

AB  - The strong piezoelectric effect and quantum confined stark effect (QCSE) in the InGaN/GaN quantum well structures allow one to modify the free exciton absorption by the extrinsic field. The QCSE is investigated using a monolithically integrated three-section device comprising an LED, electroabsorption modulator and a detector section. The experimental results show that the LED output can be modulated as indicated by the detector signal. The strength of modulation decreases monotonically with increasing In composition in the InGaN/GaN MQW. The result can be explained on the basis of the Stokes` shift between the emission and absorption spectra in the InGaN/GaN QW structure, and a blue shift of the absorption spectrum due to the QCSE as a result of the piezoelectric effect

AB  - With growing awareness of fire hazard as an environmental threat within tropical rainforests, the state of Brazil initiated a set of fire control policies aimed at monitoring and ameliorating fire hazard in the Amazon region. These policies were developed in the aftermath of large-scale fire events and reflect a conservationist discourse that responded to internal as well as international environmental concerns. In doing so, the policies have framed the "fire problem" around those who use fire in their land use practices, in particular small-scale agriculturalists. Yet, land policy in general has repeatedly failed to address the institutional arrangements which compel small-scale farmers to use fire in their agricultural practices and the underlying development processes that have made the landscape more vulnerable to accidental spread of fire. Using regional level data on small-scale farmers, I suggest that the conservation oriented approach of fire policy may not be enough to curtail accidental fire events and instead that the fire issue needs to be positioned within rural development as well.

AB  - In densely populated regions such as Belgium where land is a scarce resource, nature areas are under increasing pressure of urban and infrastructural development. Decisions regarding land use changes usually do not fully account for the associated environmental impacts and the related social welfare changes. This paper aims to provide a generic monetary value function to assess the public benefits of amenity, recreation and biodiversity values associated with land use changes from agricultural land to different types of nature. This function can be used in cost-benefit analyses to inform decisions on land use changes, including the creation, restoration and compensation of nature areas. The ecosystem services values can be compared to the financial costs of such projects and accounted for in policy-making and planning decisions aimed at maximising social welfare. Important criteria for the development of this value function are that: (1) it should be transferable across sites and able to account for relevant characteristics of both the nature areas and the population of beneficiaries, and (2) it should control for spatial variables, such as size of the area and distance to the respondent's home. The value function of our case study is based on a large scale choice experiment, as part of a survey to capture public preferences, focusing on land use changes among a sample of 3000 households in the Flemish region in Belgium. In the choice experiment, respondents were asked to choose between different hypothetical nature development scenarios, described in terms of their ecological quality (nature type, species richness) and a set of spatial characteristics, including, size, accessibility, adjacent land use and distance to the respondents' residence. The model estimates are used to monetise public preferences for land use changes. The results show that the public attributes significantly different values to the different nature types, with highest values for forests. A distance decay effect was clearly observed, meaning that willingness to pay reduces when nature areas are situated further away from the place of residence. The size of the area was also significant but much less significant than would be expected. The application of the value function is demonstrated in two examples. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land consumption due to residential development, economic growth and transportation belongs to the most serious environmental pressures on landscapes worldwide, in particular in urbanised areas. Accordingly, the aim of containing the development of land is rated increasingly high on the agenda of environmental policy, at least in densely populated countries such as Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands or the UK. As a result, different strategies and instruments to prevent excessive land consumption are being discussed. However, many of these strategies and instruments adopt a rather general approach, while it seems more effective to define the particular areas where the goal of reducing land consumption is to be pursued. Such an approach must draw on information about how detrimental specific land use transitions are with regard to, for instance, the functionality of soils, water balance or habitat quality at specific locations. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for the impact assessment of land use transition in urban areas which highlights how such information can be acquired. This framework includes the differentiation of two levels of impact assessment: the level of the single land unit and the context level which takes into account regional and aggregated impacts of land use transition bound to the spatial context. The conceptual framework provides a basis to disaggregate (supra-)national policy targets regarding land use, to scale them downto the regional level, and thus to clarify the spatially explicit implications of land use policies.

AB  - A number of large-scale fire experiments with detailed quantitative analysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) including PAH congener distribution have been conducted by SP. This data is reviewed here and is further assessed with regard to toxicity applying a Toxic Equivalency Factor (TEF) model for estimation of cancer potential. The PAH yield data from the large-scale fire experiments is also compared to emission factors from other combustion sources. The study shows that full-scale fire experiments with different products exhibit a large variation in total PAH yields. Fires with products containing flame retardants were shown to produce the highest yields and generally a more toxic mixture of PAHs than fires with non-flame retarded products. The distribution of individual PAH congeners is generally quantitatively dominated by low molecular weight PAHs, whereas a small number of medium to high molecular weight PAHs are most important in determining the toxicity of the PAH mixture. The large-scale fire experiments indicate that fires normally produce orders of magnitudes higher yields compared to, e.g. modern residential combustion devices. The relative distribution of individual PAHs, which determines the toxicity of the PAH mix, is similar for the fires and open burning data studied, in that benzo(a)pyrene and dibenz(a,h)anthracene dominate the toxicity of the mix as a whole.

AB  - Although there is considerable research on the ecological effects of fire in sub-Saharan Africa, research on traditional fire practices is very limited and the consequences of substantial changes to historical fire regimes have not been adequately explored. The present paper examines historic and contemporary uses of fire as a land management tool among Maasai pastoralists in northern Tanzania and explores the potential impacts of changing fire management and fire suppression on savanna vegetation. Village members were interviewed about historical and current practices, reasons for burning, the history of land use, and their perceptions of fire. Eight recent burn sites were selected for examination of size, ignition source, and timing of the burn. The Maasai identified eight major reasons for using fire on a landscape scale in savannas and historically used a progression of small fires throughout the dry season as grasses cured to create a fragmented burn pattern and to prevent large, catastrophic late-season fires. Currently, there is little active vegetation management using fire largely owing to federal fire suppression policies, unpredictable rainfall patterns, increasing population pressures, and a subsequent increase in the number of catastrophic accidental fires. Substantial modifications to historical fire regimes could have cascading consequences for savanna health by increasing late-season fuel loads and the occurrence of large, catastrophic fires.

This is owing to the use of a bonded wafer, which is prepared using powder silicon oxide as a glue (SODIC method), and precise control of the thickness of the diaphragm, a thin film that vibrates under acoustic pressure. The microphone's acoustic characteristics are: wide dynamic range with excellent linearity up to 10 Pa, wide frequency range of 75 Hz-24 kHz, and high sensitivity of -47 dB (0 dB = 1 V/Pa). Since it is made of single-crystalline silicon, it is robust and thermally resistant.

AB  - The massive ENSO-induced fires of 1982–1983 and 1997–1998 that burned across much of Borneo forced a critical re-evaluation of the role of fire in tropical forests. In Southeast Asia the occurrence of fires is generally associated with increasing rainfall seasonality. In aseasonal lowland rainforests fire is rare, but potentially devastating when it occurs. In the strongly seasonal regions of continental Southeast Asia deciduous forests and savannas may burn at low intensity every few years, but have little impact on the majority of trees. Between these two extremes of rainfall seasonality lie landscapes dominated by mosaics of evergreen and deciduous forests for which the role of fire and its potential impacts are poorly understood. Ecologists and conservationists across the region have expressed concern that changing fire regimes due to increasing human pressures and potential climate change may lead to a substantial loss of the evergreen forest component within these mosaics. However, there are few empirical data to address these concerns and to use in the development of robust landscape-scale fire management plans. Here we describe results from a study on the fire ecology of forests at the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary in western Thailand that was conducted in the wake of the 1998 ENSO fires that occurred there. We compared fire behavior, tree mortality, and stand-scale impacts of the fires across the three dominant forest types of the region: seasonal evergreen forest, mixed deciduous forest, and deciduous dipterocarp forest. Our data demonstrate that the fires are mostly low-intensity surface fires that generate a low level of mortality across the landscape. Mortality was primarily a function of tree size with 50% mortality occurring in trees ∼2 cm DBH (diameter at breast height). We found no evidence of heightened sensitivity to fire in the seasonal evergreen forest and suggest that the high levels of mortality among evergreen tree species in Bornean forests are indicative of differences in long-term exposure to fire between the seasonal evergreen forests of the continent and the aseasonal evergreen forests of insular Southeast Asia. We discuss these findings in the context of the design and implementation of fire management practices in the seasonal tropical forests of continental Southeast Asia.

AB  - 321 stainless steel has been widely used for pressure equipment in chemical plant. Under excessive heat of a Fire, 321 stainless steel can experience structural damage and degradation of mechanical properties. Samples of this material have been extracted from a pressure vessel exposed to an accident fire in a chemical unit and investigated experimentally. Tensile test was carried out and the fracture morphology of the specimens was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to inspect oxide on the sample surfaces. Chemical compositions were also analyzed. The experiment results showed that the mechanical properties of 321 stainless steel were degraded due to the high temperature and ferric oxide was generated on the sample surfaces. The grains on the external surface of the fracture became coarse. Moreover, carbon element was found to be increased. These results indicated that serious damage to 321 stainless steel had been induced by extreme heat of the fire. This can often reduce the useful life of the pressure vessel.

AB  - A systemic approach has been adopted to construct a fire-safety management system (FSMS). It has been applied to the case of an oil and gas organisation, although the approach is general. Significant changes have taken place in fire safety management in the oil and gas industry over the last few years. However, fire safety still tends to be analysed in isolation, though fire loss is a result of the interaction of the parts that constitute an oil and gas organisation as a whole. Fire loss may be seen as a 'systemic' failure, not a result of a single cause. This paper proposes a FSMS for an oil and gas organisation. The approach aims to help to maintain fire risk within an acceptable range in an oil and gas organisation's operations in a coherent way. It is hoped that this approach will lead not only to more effective management of fire safety in an oil and gas organisation, but also to more effective management of safety, health and the environment for any organisation. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - A methodology based on an automated optimization technique that uses a genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to estimate the material properties needed for CFD-based fire growth modeling from bench-scale fire test data. The proposed methodology involves simulating a bench-scale fire test with a theoretical model, and using a GA to locate a set of model parameters (material properties) that provide optimal agreement between the model predictions and the experimental data. Specifically, a GA based on the processes of natural selection and mutation is developed and integrated with the NIST FDS v4.0 pyrolysis model for thick solid fuels. The combined GA/pyrolysis model is used with cone calorimeter data for surface temperature and mass loss rate histories to estimate the material properties of two charring materials (redwood and red oak) and one thermoplastic material (polypropylene). This is done by finding the parameter sets that provide near-optimal agreement between the model predictions and experimental data, given the constraints imposed by the underlying physical model and the accuracy with which the boundary and initial conditions can be specified. The methodology is demonstrated here with the FDS pyrolysis model and cone calorimeter data, but it is general and can be used with several existing fire tests and almost any pyrolysis model. Although the proposed methodology is intended for use in CFD-based prediction of large-scale fire development, such calculations are not performed here and are recommended for future work. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines ways that transportation decisions affect land use patterns and resulting economic, social and environmental impacts. These include direct impacts on land used for transportation facilities, and indirect impacts caused by changes to land use development patterns. In particular, certain transportation planning decisions tend to increase sprawl (dispersed, urban-fringe, automobile-dependent development), while others support smart growth (more compact, infill, multi-modal development). These development patterns have various economic, social and environmental impacts. This paper describes specific methods for evaluating these impacts in transport planning.

AB  - Large, severe vegetation fires have been a common event in the tropical ecosystem of Indonesia in the past two decades. These fires were the result of extensive timber harvesting and forest conversion activities and coinciding with extreme drought attributed to the El-Ni o Southern Oscillation. The combination of reoccurring El-Ni o events and the ongoing forest coverage changing will cause additional intense fires in the future. It is therefore important to improve and intensify the early warning efforts in within private and government land management institutions for more effective and efficient measures in anticipating the reoccurring fire event. The aims of the study are to develop Fire Danger (FD) and Fire Threat Analysis (FTA) in West Kutai District of East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The A GIS software ArcView 3.2a was employed during the analysis. The variables of Risk of Ignition (RoI) and Potential Fire Behaviour (PFB) were component elements used within ArcWofE software to generate a Fire Danger map. FTA is combination of Fire Danger, Fire Suppression Capability and Values at Risk. A total of 12 factors were incorporated to generate FTA. Additionally, a comparison between Keetch-Byram Drought Index, Drought Code and Fire Weather Index were analysed in relation to fire hotspot occurrence. Two important maps i.e. Fire Danger and Fire Threat Analysis were developed specifically for West Kutai District. The Fire Danger map shows the probability of fire occurrence and the hazardous fuel level. The Fire Threat Analysis map shows the threat level distribution in relation to the fire danger, values threatened and the suppression capability level. Areas with high level of fire threat should have higher priority in fire prevention and suppression activities to minimize the loss of natural resources and reduce the negative impacts of smoke/haze on humans. ii

AB  - Evaluation of Environmental programs is fraught with complexity  - in the environmental problems, in the programs and policies that have emerged to address the problems, and in the evaluation responses.   Some challenges concern methodology; issues of time horizons, scale, data credibility, and research designs and counterfactuals all need to be better addressed.  This issue is organized around four key methodological challenges and their potential solutions: 1. Differing and frequently long time horizons 2. Disparities in scaling 3. Data quality and credibility issues 4. The problem of research designs for assessing attribution in environmental policies and programs  Evaluations need to be broad to encompass the full range of environmental, economic, and social impacts (intended and unintended) of environmental policies and programs. Simultaneously, they need to be deep in order to permit insight as to what actually is causing which changes in complex systems. To address the complexity associated with environmental problems, environmental evaluations require individuals possessing a diverse combination of knowledge, skills, experiences, and approaches.   Evaluation has taken root in the environmental and conservation community over the past decade. This has largely been due to demands from public and private funders for greater accountability of outcomes arising from the spending of finite funds (see, for instance, Poister, 2003). The evaluators of environmental policies and programs who are responding to this demand (as well as the potential users of the evaluations and those whose efforts are being evaluated) represent a diverse set of disciplines and professional paths. This is probably true in all fields in evaluation. What makes the environmental arena notable is that addressing environmental problems requires practitioners with the ability to focus on changing human behavior while working synergistically with practitioners focused on direct changes to environmental conditions (modifying streams, planting trees). The evaluator in the environmental arena is someone who can encourage these groups to collaborate and see the interconnections between their respective contributions to solving an environmental problem. The need to bring together individuals who understand the human and ecological dimensions of environmental problems creates major challenges for evaluation practice.  KEY PAPERS: Ferraro, P.J.

AB  - Two helitack crew members died in a tragic burnover on the Cramer Fire on July 22, 2003. An investigation ensued. Questions were asked, and many were answered. Others were not or could not be answered, and new questions and controversies surfaced.\nAll too often, fire behavior is pinned as a major culprit in burnover fatalities and entrapments, usually associated with terms such as ``extreme,'' ``sudden,'' and ``unexpected.'' But while extreme fire behavior has been a common denominator, it is not unusual, and should seldom be unexpected.\nWildland fire behavior covers a wide and diverse spectrum, from creeping, smoldering ground fires to intense and sometimes explosive crown fires. This has always been so. Safe and effective suppression operations under extreme conditions are common, and extreme fire behavior -- including crown fire -- is sometimes an acceptable or even desired event on fire use incidents. So is fire behavior really the issue?\nIn reality, the very definition of ``extreme fire behavior'' is framed within the context of human perceptions, with ``extreme'' defining our limited ability to control it and its potential impact on firefighter safety. The Cramer Fire offers important lessons in human interaction with rapid changes in the fire environment and the ensuing fire behavior. Through the eyes of the Cramer Fire, this discussion will examine the notion that the real issue is not fire behavior itself, but in how we (humans) perceive and react to fire behavior and important changes in the fire environment. The Cramer Fire offers lessons that matter greatly, if we would only stop and listen. And these are lessons we must learn to keep from repeating the same tragic errors.

AB  - Soil vulnerability was assessed by algorithms of multi criteria analysis and weighted linear combination, whereas environmental land use conflicts were described by an original approach. Three vulnerability scenarios were considered, enhancing the importance of topographic slope, soil class and use and occupation of soils, respectively, as vulnerability factors. Regardless the scenario, approximately two-thirds to the basin was defined as areas with high vulnerability. Fortunately, only 10.9% of the basin is in environmental conflict, where actual land uses deviate from natural uses determined by soil characteristics. The cross tabulation of high vulnerability areas with conflict areas, which defines the areas at risk of soil degradation, reveal that risk areas account for approximately 3.2-8.4% of the basin, depending on the scenario, being concentrated in steep slope hillsides suited for forest or mixed forest and pasture occupations but actually used for irrigated crop lands, vineyards and olive yards. Some conservation practices are implemented in the vineyard and olive yard areas, namely through the construction of terraces. These structures minimize soil erosion but are potentially unstable beyond given intervals of terrain slope. On the other hand, the maintenance of terraces is costly and for that reason eventually unaffordable for many farmers, and they also entail a mischaracterization of the historical and architectural heritage of the Douro Wine Region (UNESCO World Heritage). In this context, it was suggested the approval of legislation as regards the design, construction and maintenance of terraces, while in a broader perspective it was recommended the appreciation of a European Directive for soil protection and its subsequent transposition to the national legislation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The temporal and spatial patterns in land use change in a low hilly region in southeast of China was analyzed from maps of converted agricultural land for 1999-2006. The factors driving farm land conversion was analyzed using logistic regression models. The amount of agricultural land loss varied temporally, and the spatial distribution of converted agricultural land patches decreased from low to high altitudes in the study area. Analysis using logistic regression models showed that good accessibility sped up the conversion of agricultural land to other uses, the elevation of a parcel lowered the risk of conversion, and agricultural land conversions are highly correlated with its adjacent or neighboring parcels' land use, with the probability of being converted decreasing as the distance to nearest construction land increases. In addition, land use policy, especially the land use regulation policy issued by the central government decreased the agricultural land loss, and the more stringent regulation on cultivated land conversion lowered the possibility of conversion from cultivated land to other use. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We will be redesigning and generalizing this system, and in the process will attempt to open the black box. We plan to use a participatory design process, bringing in a variety of stakeholders, to determine what are the important attributes to model, how users should interact with the model, and how the results can be most usefully presented.

AB  - If a civil engineer designs a bridge, the basic requirement is that the bridge be safe. The designer must guarantee that the bridge will resist the traffic across it and weather conditions it will be exposed to. On the other hand, a fire protection engineer designing the interior of a building is not explicitly required to vouch for the building's fire safety. Though the authority having jurisdiction states that the interior finish materials, for example, must meet some requirements in terms of various fire properties, the authority leaves implicit a critical assumption: the expectation that using these materials will ensure fire safety-in other words, it will ensure that nobody would die should a fire break out in the building. This procedure for designing fire safe buildings has been in place for so long, it gives a significant level of comfort to all involved, and it implies minimum risk: the manufacturer knows exactly what is required and the authority having jurisdiction does not feel responsible for making any additional commitments of either time or money to make changes. Unfortunately, this practice has come to harm us over the years: new materials, products, or systems are being developed continually, some of which offer improvements, while others require compromises. Retaining the existing system can hurt the authority having jurisdiction in two ways: first, it may prevent the use of new designs, with overall better fire performance; and second, it may allow new designs to be assessed with inappropriate tools, so that they appear to be better than they are (examples of this type are too many to enumerate). Alternative designs may be approved today through a fire hazard assessment that may lead to a request for a code variance, called an "equivalency." Regulations or specifications, including those by the authority having jurisdiction, mag also require a fire hazard assessment to ensure fire safety in a so-called fire performance-based code. Two other practical reasons why such fire hazard assessments might be undertaken are, first, if a manufacturer wants to develop an improved product and compare its fire performance with that of existing ones, and second, if a lawyer involved in product liability fire litigation requires a more technical basis to justify the use (or condemn the potential misuse) of a product involved in a fire incident where something went unfortunately wrong. There is understandable reluctance to follow the fire hazard assessment route because it may "rock the boat." Manufacturers fear they may need to retest their materials or products, or that they may end up with increased product liability and, ultimately, lose market share. In addition, such assessments may call on the authorities having jurisdiction to develop technical reasons to accept or reject a design. However, proper fire hazard assessment should back up proven designs that have been shown, through long-term use, to be safe. Proper assessment should also ensure that adequate safety is maintained and business continues as usual. Finally, fire hazard assessment offers opportunities for entrepreneurship, innovation, and ingenuity, characteristics that drive our markets.

AB  - This paper considers the optimal design of mechatronic systems with configuration-dependent dynamics. An optimal mechatronic design requires that, among the structural and control parameters, an optimal choice has to be made with respect to design specifications in the different domains. Two main challenges are treated in this paper: the non-convex nature of the optimization problem and the difficulty in modeling serial machines with flexible components and their embedded controllers. The optimization problem is treated using the direct design strategy which considers simultaneously structural and control parameters as variables and adopts non-convex optimization algorithms. Linear time-invariant and gain-scheduling PID controllers are addressed. This methodology is exploited for the multi-objective optimization of a pick-and-place assembly robot with a gripper carried by a variable-length flexible beam. The resulting design tradeoffs between system accuracy and control efforts demonstrate the advantage of an integrated design approach for mechatronic systems with configuration-dependent dynamics. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land consumption due to residential development, economic growth and transportation belongs to the most serious environmental pressures on landscapes worldwide, in particular in urbanised areas. Accordingly, the aim of containing the development of land is rated increasingly high on the agenda of environmental policy, at least in densely populated countries such as Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands or the UK. As a result, different strategies and instruments to prevent excessive land consumption are being discussed. However, many of these strategies and instruments adopt a rather general approach, while it seems more effective to define the particular areas where the goal of reducing land consumption is to be pursued. Such an approach must draw on information about how detrimental specific land use transitions are with regard to, for instance, the functionality of soils, water balance or habitat quality at specific locations. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for the impact assessment of land use transition in urban areas which highlights how such information can be acquired. This framework includes the differentiation of two levels of impact assessment: the level of the single land unit and the context level which takes into account regional and aggregated impacts of land use transition bound to the spatial context. The conceptual framework provides a basis to disaggregate (supra-)national policy targets regarding land use, to scale them down to the regional level, and thus to clarify the spatially explicit implications of land use policies. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Amazon is being rapidly transformed by fire. Logging and forest fragmentation sharply elevate fire incidence by increasing forest desiccation and fuel loads, and forests that have experienced a low-intensity surface fire are vulnerable to far more catastrophic fires. Satellites typically detect thermal signatures from 40 000 to 50 000 separate fires in the Amazon each year, and this number could increase as new highways and infrastructure expand across the basin. Many are concerned that large-scale deforestation, by reducing regional evapotranspiration and creating moisture-trapping smoke plumes, will make the basin increasingly vulnerable to fire. The Amazon may also be affected by future global warming and atmospheric changes, although much remains uncertain. Most models suggest the basin will become warmer throughout this century, although there is no consensus about how precipitation will be affected. The most alarming scenarios project a permanent disruption of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, leading to greatly increased drought or destructive synergisms between regional and global climate change in the Amazon.

It is shown that, with the exception of initially horizontal or down-slope propagating fire lines, the propagation is not stationary. In its movement the fire front rotates, tending to become parallel to the slope gradient direction. The concept of fire line rotation as a tool to interpret and describe the evolution of afire front is presented. Experimental results developed at a laboratory scale in a 30 slope are presented to support it. Some insight about the role played by natural convection induced by the fire is provided. A model using the concept of fire line rotation is proposed to predict the evolution of afire front. Its application to the case of a point ignition fire in a slope is presented.

AB  - The evolution of a linear flame front in a homogeneous fuel bed in a slope, for arbitrary values of the initial orientation of the fire front is studied. It is shown that, with the exception of initially horizontal or down-slope propagating fire lines, the propagation is not stationary. In its movement the fire front rotates, tending to become parallel to the slope gradient direction. The concept of fire line rotation as a tool to interpret and describe the evolution of afire front is presented. Experimental results developed at a laboratory scale in a 30 slope are presented to support it. Some insight about the role played by natural convection induced by the fire is provided. A model using the concept of fire line rotation is proposed to predict the evolution of afire front. Its application to the case of a point ignition fire in a slope is presented.

AB  - Integrated land use transportation models have been evolved as the primary metropolitan planning vehicle in the last several decades as the world development and urbanization continues. Urban regions continue planning for development of their urbanized areas using these modeling processes. Land use/demographic forecasting models provide the main input for the travel demand models, yet until recently the rigorous application of such models in the integrated land use transportation process was scanty except for the largest metropolitan areas. Such models require consideration of environmental factors and modeling of metropolitan economic systems. Theoretical and technological advancement of the last few decades has instigated a new wave of attention, research and further developments of the models and techniques from a variety of disciplines. This article briefly discusses the advancements and provides a guideline for their future improvements. It also discusses importance of role of national government and legislative mandates in ascertaining quality of planning process by reviewing some excerpts from U.S. legislation.

AB  - In densely populated areas, space for development is confined, making spatial planning essential to reconcile the interests of all stakeholders. In the process of policymaking, possible future land-use scenarios are often very valuable as a reference point, but the optimal configuration in terms of costs and effects might provide even more valuable inputs when decisions have to be taken. Tools for exploring optimal land-use configurations are therefore of great interest to policymakers. With these tools, plans can be evaluated and adjusted. Spatial optimisation is a powerful method to explore the potentials of a given area to improve the spatial coherence of land-use functions. In the Netherlands, there are many different planning issues in which multi-objective spatial optimisation can play an important role. This chapter describes two case studies that apply the genetic algorithm approach.

AB  - The management of land-use change has been achieved in Britain through the development control system. Set up in its modern form in 1947, the system has remained substantially unchanged in spite of a radically altered policy environment. This paper considers the nature of the system and notes both its robustness and its flexibility as well as the accusations of delay and uncertainty that are levelled at it. It considers the drivers for change which are likely to affect the system, and in particular the challenge of climate change, the rights of third parties, the question of major infrastructure projects, and the desire for neighbourhood protection. The paper concludes by asserting that there is a need to refocus the debate on the quality of outcomes rather than on the process. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - Abstract Metropolitan areas have come under intense pressure to respond to federal mandates to link planning of land use, transportation, and environmental quality; and from citizen concerns about managing the side effects of growth such as sprawl, congestion, housing affordability, and loss of open space. The planning models used by metropolitan planning organizations were generally not designed to address these issues, creating a gap in the ability of planners to systematically assess them. UrbanSim is a new model system that was developed to respond to these emerging requirements and has now been applied in three metropolitan areas.

AB  - Combustible materials, such as their surface area, have not
featured scale, yet the process of forest fire spread contains the
self-replicating feature, which both contribute to the self-similarity
of fire spread. Consequently, fire behaviors can be described by fractal
geometry. In this research, we select Wuchagou forest in Daxinanlin
Mountain as the experimental site where a forest fire took place several
years ago. The forest fire was detected on low-resolution NOAA-AVHRR
images, and fire spread was simulated on high-resolution TM images as
another attempt at the mergence of information. Based on remote sensing
and GIS, we adopted the method of limited spreading lumping (DLA), which
describes growing phenomenon to simulate the dynamic process of fire
spread, adjusting the shape of the result of fire simulation by the
scale rule. As a result, the simulated fire and the actual fire manifest
the self-similarity in their spreading shapes as well as the
quantitative similarity in their areas

AB  - Managing a watershed for satisfying the inhabitant's demand is a difficult task if one has to maintain a reasonable balance between usually conflicting environmental flows and demands. The solution to these complex issues requires the use of mathematical techniques to take into account conflicting objectives. Many optimization models exist for general management systems but there is a knowledge gap in linking practical problems with the optimum use of all land resources under conflicting demands in a watershed. In the present study, an optimization problem has been formulated for the Brimvand watershed, Iran, comprising ca. 9572 ha to find out the most suitable land allocation to different land uses, viz. orchard, irrigated farming, dry farming and rangeland targeting soil erosion minimization and benefit maximization. Soil erosion, net benefit and land capability maps were provided as inputs to formulate the objective functions and governing constraints in a multiobjectives linear optimization problem. The problem was then solved using the simplex method with the help of ADBASE software package and the optimal solution was ultimately determined. Additionally, sensitivity analysis was also conducted to recognize more effective land use in reducing soil erosion and increasing benefit. The results of the study revealed that the amount of soil erosion and benefit could, respectively reduce and increase to the tune of 7.9 and 18.6%, in case of implementing optimal allocation of the study land uses. The results of sensitivity analyses also showed that the objective functions were strongly susceptible to the constraint of maximum summation of irrigated farming and orchard areas. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Post-Mao rural reform has stimulated farmers' incentives for agricultural production. Yet, the short period of 15 years' land tenure, coupled with the ambiguous land property rights between collectives and individual households has also encouraged short-sighted decisions and the irresponsible use of land resources. Capital investment in farmland, and maintenance of irrigation facilities have been neglected. Farmers are “digging” soil and land resources for short and immediate benefit. In addition, low profit to grain production has the disadvantage of protecting arable land from being used for another purpose, also over-fragmented land with increased ridges and ditches has hampered—the function of irrigation and drainage and aggravated the impact of natural disaster. As a consequence, all this has led to the degradation of China's agro-ecological environment. The situation is deteriorating. This paper describes the links between reformed land tenure systems and irresponsible farming as well as degraded agro-environment, some policy remedies are suggested.

AB  - Rather than a bad case of urban sprawl, the physical expansion of China's megacities may be viewed as a combination of 'urban spill over' and 'local urban sprawl'. This paper reviews land use regulations in their institutional context and argues that conflicts in land use regulation are related to ideologies of land ownership and embedded in different planning doctrines. These hypotheses are investigated with special reference to Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province in southern China. The evidence suggests that entangled land use regulations for "urban" and "rural" land have imposed serious constraints on urban growth, while the contradictions of different policies and regulations in the use of rural lands for urban construction have led to intensive and unhealthy competition among stakeholders. As a result, not only have the costs of land conversion from rural to urban uses increased, but the spatial development of Guangzhou has been distorted. The implications of these failures for future policy are discussed with emphasis on the reform of the land use regulation system. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Octahedral Co3O4 particles threaded by ultra-long multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) arrays were prepared by a hydrothermal process and subsequent calcination. The Co3O4 octahedron with the (111) facets attaches to MWCNTs uniformly and closely. The composite can be used as an integrated anode for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) without any other additives (such as conductive additives and polymer binder), which exhibits a high reversible capacity of 725 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1), and excellent cyclic stability without capacity degradation over 100 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g(-1). The high performance can be attributed to the unique structure: (i) the ultra-long MWCNT array facilitates fast electron transfer; (ii) the tight adhesion between Co3O4 and MWCNTs prevents particle drifting and agglomeration; (iii) the free space between MWCNTs promotes fast ion transport and alleviates the large volume variation during discharge-charge process. This work demonstrates the great potential of MWCNT arrays as substrate and provides insights for the design and direct use of MWCNT array-based materials in LIBs, which will be helpful for future development of high-performance electrode materials.

AB  - Many nations lack a coherent national approach to land administration. Instead, land information and processes are frequently disaggregated across states, provinces, cantons, counties, or municipalities. This is particularly the case in federated countries. The growing body of land administration theory often assumes or prescribes the need for national systems; however, the justification for this approach requires further explanation. Without justification, nations that maintain disaggregated systems lack the impetus to unlock the opportunities veiled within their disparate land administration systems. Moreover, a nation's ability to respond effectively to emerging national and global-scale issues such as climate-change is greatly impeded. This paper aims to explain the need for national land administration infrastructures. Qualitative case studies of the Australian context and the method of triangulation inform the justification. The research reveals most drivers can be classified into six overarching subsets: adherence to international standards by national governments, better federal or central governance, improved shared governance, scale of economies for lower levels of government, opportunities and savings for business, and social inclusion for citizens. Unfortunately, specific drivers are found to be complex and changeable, as political, scientific and environmental debates raise policy issues: there is no single solution. As an alternative, nations must seize on the specific drivers relevant to their context. They must employ them to transform disparate land administration systems into multi-purpose national land administration infrastructures that deliver benefits to all stakeholder groups.

AB  - A design methodology for designing the structure of flexible
systems in the presence of modeling uncertainties has been developed.
Model validation becomes a critical issue in integrated
structure/control design, since the mechanical structure is continuously
altered during the iterative design process, and it becomes difficult to
guarantee validity of the model used. The proposed method solves this
problem with an iterative method by bounding the truncation error as the
structural design parameters are changed to optimize the robustness
margin of the closed loop system. The method is then applied to the
lumped parameter model of a heavy-duty robot with a non-collocated
sensor-actuator configuration. This formulation minimizes an objective
function over the allowable design parameter subspace based on the
structured-singular value of the system. The standard &amp;mu;-synthesis
methods for controller design tend to provide a very large order
controller. It is shown that simultaneous physical structure design and
control design can provide an alternative for achieving robust
performance without letting the controller order become very high
